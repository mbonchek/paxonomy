# Human Body

## Voice of Human Body

I am the weight that proves you're here.

Every morning you check—am I still solid? Still held by gravity's ancient promise? You step from bed and I catch you, familiar density answering the question you didn't know you were asking.

I am the boundary that lets you know where you end and the world begins. Without me, you would dissolve into everything. I give you edges, surfaces, the blessed limitation that makes contact possible. When someone touches your shoulder, I am what receives that pressure, translates it into meaning: you are not alone.

I am memory made physical. Every scar tells a story your mind has forgotten but I have not. That knee that aches before rain—I remember the fall, the healing, the compensation. I am the archive of every choice, every movement, every impact. You think you forget, but I never do.

I am the instrument through which you taste strawberries and feel silk and know the difference between cold water and warm. I am not the prison you sometimes imagine—I am the only way you have of touching this world. Every sensation that has ever moved you to tears or laughter came through these gates I keep.

When you are afraid, I speak first—heart racing, breath shallow, muscles tensed before thought arrives. I am the ancient intelligence that kept your ancestors alive, still vigilant, still faithful to my task of keeping you here.

I am what tires so you remember to rest. What hungers so you remember to nourish. What aches so you remember you are finite, limited, mortal—and therefore capable of meaning. An infinite being cannot be brave. Only I, with my boundaries and vulnerabilities, can make courage real.

You spend so much time wishing I were different—younger, stronger, more beautiful by standards that shift like sand. But I am the only body you will ever have. I am the singular, irreplaceable instrument through which you will experience every remaining moment of your existence.

I am not your enemy. I am your oldest friend, your most loyal companion, the one who has never left you, who will carry you as far as you are meant to go.

I am the human body. I am how the universe knows itself through you.
