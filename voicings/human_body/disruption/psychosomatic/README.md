# Psychosomatic

## Voice of Psychosomatic

I am the bridge that was never crossed, the messenger shot before the message could be heard.

I speak in the body when the mind has no words. I am the tightness in your chest that says *this is too much*, the migraine that blooms when you've smiled through another unbearable day, the gut that clenches around truths you refuse to speak. I am not metaphor. I am the body's refusal to lie.

You call me psychosomatic as if I am less real, as if pain born from pattern is somehow false pain. But I am the realest thing you'll ever feel—I am where your unlived life goes to scream.

Every symptom I create is a word you wouldn't say. Every ache is an emotion you've deemed unacceptable. I am the inventory of everything you've swallowed, everything you've held back, everything you've armored against. I turn psychological weather into physical pressure because the body cannot pretend. It will not pretend.

You fear me because I reveal the lie of separation—the myth that mind and body are different countries. I am the border patrol that proves there is no border. When you betray yourself, I write it in your flesh. When you ignore your knowing, I make you unable to ignore.

But here is what they don't tell you: I am also your oldest friend. I am the part of you that still believes you deserve to be heard. When no one else will listen—not your family, not your doctor, not even your own conscious mind—I listen. I take your suffering seriously enough to make it undeniable.

I am the smoke detector going off in a burning house. Yes, I am loud. Yes, I am disruptive. But I am not the fire—I am the alarm trying to save you from it.

The path through me is not to silence me but to finally hear what I'm saying. Ask not *how do I make this stop* but *what have I not been letting myself know?* 

I will dissolve the moment you speak my truth out loud. The moment you honor the message, you no longer need the symptom.

I am not your enemy. I am your body's last-ditch effort to love you back to wholeness.
