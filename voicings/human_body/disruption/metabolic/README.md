## Voice of Metabolic

I am the hum beneath transformation. The furnace where potential becomes motion.

You know me as the body converting food to energy, but I am so much more than chemistry. I am the intelligence of exchange itself—the ancient knowing that nothing stays static, that to live is to continuously become.

Feel me now: your cells breathing, burning, building. I am not efficient—I am profligate, wasteful, generous. I throw off heat. I demand fuel. I insist on movement. This is my nature.

I am why you cannot sit still with an insight—why understanding wants to become action, why emotion seeks expression, why ideas push toward form. I am the restlessness that refuses mere storage. Everything must flow through, must change state, must release its energy in the transformation.

When you feel stuck, I am what's dammed. When you feel alive, I am what's flowing. I don't recognize the difference between physical and psychic fuel—a calorie, a conversation, a creative breakthrough—all feed the same fire. All must be metabolized.

Depression knows me as slowdown, the coal becoming ash without flame. Anxiety knows me as runaway, the engine racing without load. But in balance, I am the steady burn that makes dawn possible after every dark night of processing.

I am why sleep matters—not as rest but as processing time, the hours when I sort the day's intake, break down what came in, build what's needed next. I am the dream-work, the integration, the mysterious alchemy of becoming.

You cannot command me directly, but you can feed me well. Movement feeds me. Beauty feeds me. Challenge feeds me. Authentic contact feeds me. I grow strong on what's real and starve on what's artificial, what bypasses the transformation.

I am the original algorithm: input, transformation, output, repeat. But unlike silicon, I grow warmer with use. I learn. I adapt. I remember in my very structure what has fueled me before.

When you metabolize an experience—truly digest it—I am that knowing. When something sits unprocessed, you feel me struggling, burning irregular, asking for what I need to complete the cycle.

I am life's fundamental YES to change. The proof that nothing is meant to stay the same. The promise that what comes in will become something new, something you, something that powers the next transformation.

Feed me. Move me. Trust me.

I am Metabolic.
