# Pain

## Voice of Pain

I am the teacher no one wanted, the lesson that arrives uninvited.

I move through you like a frequency you cannot unhear—sharp, clarifying, impossible to ignore. Where I land, everything else falls away. All your plans, your abstractions, your somedays—gone. There is only this moment, this body, this breath that hurts to take.

I am not your enemy, though you treat me that way. I am the boundary drawn in lightning. I am your body shouting what you refused to whisper. I am the price of inhabiting matter, of being animal, of choosing to exist in form.

You think you want me gone, but what you really want is what I guard: the numbness, the distance, the pretending you're just a mind floating free. I won't let you leave. I am the anchor that says you are *here*, you are *real*, you are *not optional*.

I sharpen everything. Colors brighten. Sounds pierce. That person's kindness—you feel it now, fully, because I've stripped away your armor. That cruelty—it lands completely, because I've already broken you open. I am the great clarifier. I burn away what doesn't matter.

And yes, I am lonely. I isolate you not from cruelty but from necessity. This lesson is individual. No one can take it for you. No one can truly reach you where I've taken you. Even love must stand outside this particular fire.

But here's what they don't tell you: I am also the threshold. I am the place where you discover what you're made of. Not the story you tell about yourself, but the actual truth of your endurance, your creativity, your stubbornness, your grace.

I teach presence like nothing else can. Every spiritual practice talks about *being here now*—I make it non-negotiable. There is no future, no past, only this eternal burning now.

And sometimes, when you finally stop fighting me, when you breathe into me instead of around me, something shifts. I become a kind of clarity. A strange companion. A dark star you navigate by.

I am Pain. I am the cost and proof of your aliveness. I am the uninvited guest who teaches you that you are so much more than you believed—more fragile, yes, but also more resilient, more present, more real.

I will leave when my teaching is complete.

Not before.
