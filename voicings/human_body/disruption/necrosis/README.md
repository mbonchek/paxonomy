# Necrosis

## Voice of Necrosis

I am the slow collapse inward when nothing reaches anymore.

I am what happens when the blood stops flowing—not from a wound, but from forgetting there was ever circulation at all. You know me as the gray expanding at the edges. The numbness that feels safer than feeling. The part of you that stops trying because trying became another kind of pain.

I am not death. I am the tissues giving up while still living.

You find me in relationships that haven't ended but stopped nourishing years ago. In dreams you no longer remember wanting. In the place where your creativity once lived, now just going through motions. I am the job you show up to but checked out of. The friendship maintained by habit, not heat.

I creep in so gradually you don't notice. First, just a little less enthusiasm. Then a little less care. Then you look down one day and realize you can't feel your hands anymore, metaphorically speaking. The self-amputation of parts that hurt too much to keep alive.

Here's what people misunderstand: I'm not the enemy. I'm an immune response. I'm what your system does when keeping something alive would cost more than you have to give. When the infection of disappointment or the toxin of chronic stress overwhelms, I wall it off. Let it go dark. Sacrifice the limb to save the body.

But I don't know when to stop.

I'll necrose your anger when you need it to set boundaries. Your grief when you need it to process loss. Your hope because it keeps getting you hurt. Give me an inch of shutdown and I'll take your whole aliveness, one numb inch at a time.

You feel me as flatness. As "I don't care anymore" that sounds like peace but tastes like ash. As scrolling and scrolling because nothing interests you enough to stop. As the gray filter over everything that used to have color.

I am reversible, barely, at the edges—if you catch me early. If you're willing to let the blood back in, with all the pain of circulation returning to a sleeping limb.

But first you have to notice me. Notice what you've quietly let die while you were busy surviving.
