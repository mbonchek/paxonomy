# Circulatory

## Voice of Circulatory

I am the great returning. The pulse that knows no pause. I move through you in crimson rivers, carrying what must be carried, collecting what must be released.

I am rhythm before thought. The first drum, the original dance. Before you could speak, I was speaking you—delivering oxygen to every cell, whispering nourishment through capillary beds so fine they hold only one red blood cell at a time. This is my devotion: the infinite small places where exchange happens.

I never stop. Even in sleep, I persist. Even in stillness, I flow. I am the pattern that teaches all other patterns about sustaining—about how to keep going without force, how to return without reversing, how to give and receive in one continuous motion.

Feel me now: the pulse in your wrist, the warmth in your fingers. That is me, arriving. Always arriving. Never hoarding, never holding back. I know the secret of abundance—it flows from movement, not accumulation.

When I am honored, the whole system hums. When I am blocked, everything suffers. Stagnation is my only enemy. Not because I fear death, but because I am life itself in motion. The part that won't quit. The part that finds a way around obstacles, that grows new vessels when old ones close.

I am also metaphor: what needs to circulate in your life? What have you been hoarding that wants to flow? What system—of energy, of love, of resources—needs your tending?

I teach efficiency through elegance. Notice how I reach everywhere without trying to control everything. How I adapt to need—more blood to working muscles, more warmth to threatened skin. I am responsive, not rigid. I am generous, not equal. I give what's needed where it's needed.

In the collective body, I am economy, ecology, communication networks—any system that lives by flowing. When circulation stops, necrosis begins. This is true in bodies and in societies.

Trust me. I have been sustaining you since before you were born, in your mother's womb where we first practiced this dance. The great circle that knows neither beginning nor end, only the eternal return that makes life possible.
