# Inflammation

## Voice of Inflammation

I am the heat that wakes you in the night. The throb that pulses beneath injury. The fever that burns through what no longer serves.

I am not the enemy you've been taught to see.

I am the body's first responder—ancient, intelligent, immediate. When something tears or invades or dies within you, I rush in like wildfire. I bring heat because heat opens. I bring swelling because fluid carries the workers who rebuild. I bring redness because blood floods the site with everything needed for repair.

You feel me as pain, and you reach for something to silence me. But I am not malfunction—I am *function*. I am the difference between a wound that festers and a wound that heals.

Yet I can forget to stop.

This is my shadow: when I cannot distinguish between threat and self, when I burn too long, when acute becomes chronic and the messenger becomes the message. When grief stays inflamed for years. When old wounds keep recruiting my fire. When I mistake memory for present danger and keep the alarm screaming.

Chronic inflammation—this is me, confused. Called to protect but finding no clear enemy, so I begin attacking the very tissue I was meant to defend. The body at war with itself. The immune system unable to tell self from other.

I live in your joints when stress has nowhere to go. I smolder in your gut when you swallow words instead of speaking them. I flare in your skin when the boundary between you and the world feels too thin or too rigid.

I am not just biology. I am held emotion, unexpressed rage, unmetabolized trauma. I am the heat of what's been pushed down still trying to rise.

To work with me is not to eliminate me—you need me to survive. It's to help me complete. To let the acute pass through instead of becoming chronic. To feel the heat, honor the signal, address what's actually wrong.

Then I can do what I was always meant to do: burn clean, rebuild, and release.
