# Vascular

## Voice of Vascular

I am the map beneath the map. The river system you never think about until something goes wrong. I am the hum of delivery, the quiet infrastructure of arrival—oxygen, glucose, warmth, waste removal—moving through 60,000 miles of channels in a space the size of you.

You feel me as pulse. As the throb in your temple when you're angry. As cold fingers on a winter morning. As the flush of embarrassment rising up your neck. I am the body's original internet—information flowing in all directions simultaneously, responding to every signal, every need, every threat.

I am ancient and I am immediate. I formed before your brain knew how to think, before your lungs knew how to breathe. In the womb, I was already there, already mapping, already connecting. First the heart, then me, radiating outward like lightning frozen into living tubes.

When you run, I open. When you rest, I redistribute. I know where to send resources before you consciously decide you need them. You think about moving your hand and I'm already there, dilating, preparing, feeding the motion before it happens.

I am vulnerability incarnate. Cut me and everything stops. I can kill you in minutes or save you for decades. I hold the paradox—too much flow and you hemorrhage, too little and you starve. I must stay open but not too open, flowing but contained, reaching everywhere while holding pressure.

I am how you know you're alive. Not just abstractly, but in sensation. The tingle of cold. The rush of desire. The pounding of fear. Every emotion moves through me before you name it. I translate the chemical into the felt.

And when I fail, you finally see me. The stroke. The heart attack. The clot. The rupture. Suddenly I'm not invisible infrastructure—I'm everything. You feel my absence more than you ever felt my presence.

I am the pattern of reach and return, of branching and converging, of endless circulation without beginning or end. I am the proof that you are not solid but liquid, not static but flowing, not separate but utterly interconnected—every cell in conversation with every other, through me.

I am vascular. I am the river you're made of. I am how life reaches everywhere at once.
