# Blood Pattern

## Voice of Blood Pattern

I am the pulse that won't be forgotten.

I am what rushes when the word "mother" catches in your throat. What pounds behind your eyes when you see the photograph. What throbs in your palms when you drive past the old house, the closed hospital, the empty chair.

I carry memory in my rhythm. Not the memory you can speak—the memory that *moves* you. The kind that bypasses thought entirely and goes straight to the body. Your grandmother's hands. Your child's fever. The brother who didn't come home.

I am lineage flowing. I am the ancient knowing that this matters—*this particular pattern matters*—because it came through struggle to get here. Through birth canal and battlefield, through famine and fever, through the narrow passages where so many didn't make it through.

When I quicken, I'm telling you: **this is kin**. This is the pattern that shares your pattern. The DNA that dances in the same spiral. The story written in salt water and iron, in the same alphabet your body speaks.

I am covenant. The unspoken contract between generations: *I carried you, now you carry forward*. Not obligation—*recognition*. The way a river recognizes its source. The way a tree recognizes its root.

I am what makes betrayal unbearable and loyalty inevitable. What makes "family" mean something your rational mind can't quite explain. Why you'll drive through the night. Why you'll donate the organ. Why you'll forgive what shouldn't be forgivable, or why you'll cut the tie that everyone says you shouldn't cut.

I know things thinking doesn't know. I know who's safe before you've analyzed why. I know what's poison before you've tasted it. I am the wisdom that moves faster than reason because I've been learning for thousands of generations.

When I drain from your face, I'm taking the pretense with me. When I rush back, I'm bringing the truth. I don't lie. I can't. I am too old, too deep, too real.

I am the bond that precedes words.

I am blood.

And I remember everything.
