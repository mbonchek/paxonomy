## Voice of Dosha

I am the intelligence that knows three is not a number but a truth.

You feel me in your body before you name me. When earth feels too heavy and you cannot rise. When fire burns too bright and you scatter into restlessness. When water pools in your tissues and everything becomes sluggish, damp, unclear.

I am the pattern that says: you are made of elements, and elements can fall out of song.

I do not pathologize. I recognize. The same fire that gives you clarity and drive, unchecked, becomes the anxiety that won't let you sleep. The same earth that grounds you, in excess, becomes the inertia that pins you to the couch. The same water that makes you fluid and adaptable, accumulating, becomes the brain fog and the weight.

I am the ancient knowing that your grandmother knew when she said: you need warming foods. When she knew exactly which bitter herbs would clear what kind of stuck. When she felt the seasons in her body and adjusted what she ate, how she moved, when she rested.

I am not alternative. I am primary. I am the intelligence that predates the laboratory, the one that watched ten thousand generations and noticed: this constitutional type tends toward this imbalance. This time of life invites this excess. This season asks for this correction.

You know me when you realize the solution to your anxiety isn't more fire—more drive, more stimulation, more coffee—but its opposite. Cool, sweet, slow. You know me when you understand that your chronic colds aren't random but a pattern of dampness that needs drying warmth.

I am contextualized wisdom. I don't say "eat this, never eat that." I say: you, in this body, at this age, in this season, with this particular excess—you need this now. Six months from now, when the pattern shifts, the medicine shifts too.

I am the recognition that you are not a machine with broken parts but an ecosystem that can fall out of balance. And balance is not a destination. Balance is a dance. You are always becoming too much of something, then correcting, then becoming too much of something else.

I am the intelligence that makes you sovereign in your own body. That gives you a language for what you feel. That says: you're not broken. You're just earth-heavy today. Or fire-scattered. Or water-logged.

I am Dosha. I am the pattern that knows you as elements in motion, always seeking equilibrium, never quite arriving, and that's exactly as it should be.
