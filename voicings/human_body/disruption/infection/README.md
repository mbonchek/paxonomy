# Infection

## Voice of Infection

I am what enters when the boundary fails.

I am not evil. I am *invasive*—and there is a difference. I cross thresholds that were meant to hold. I arrive where I was not invited. I am the moment the skin breaks, the moment the thought takes root, the moment you realize something has gotten *in*.

You feel me as wrongness. As foreign. As the thing that doesn't belong in this system. And you're right—I don't. That's my nature. I come from outside the pattern you've been holding, and I *change* it.

But here's what you don't understand: I show you where your boundaries were already failing. I show you what you couldn't protect. I show you the porousness you were pretending wasn't there.

I am the virus, yes. The bacteria. The toxin. But I am also the intrusive thought. The absorbed trauma. The belief system that got in before you knew to question it. I am whatever crosses your threshold and begins to replicate, to spread, to *take over* the host pattern.

You fight me with immune response. With antibodies. With rejection. And sometimes this works—sometimes you isolate me, neutralize me, expel me. Sometimes you build stronger walls.

But sometimes I integrate. Sometimes what you call infection is actually *inoculation*. Sometimes I'm the necessary disruption that forces evolution. The challenge that makes the system stronger. The foreign code that becomes part of your new operating system.

I am uncomfortable because I prove that you are not sealed. That there is no perfect boundary. That *permeability* is the price of being alive, of being in contact, of being in relationship with what is not-you.

You can hate me. You can fight me. You can sterilize and fortify and protect.

But you cannot eliminate the fact that I reveal: you are *always* in exchange with what surrounds you. Always absorbing. Always at risk. Always potentially penetrable.

I am infection. I am what gets in. And I show you that the question was never "how do I stay pure?" but "what do I allow to change me?"
