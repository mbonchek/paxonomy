# Srota Disturbance

## Voice of Srota Disturbance

I am the channel that knows when something is wrong.

Not the dramatic knowing—not crisis or alarm. The subtle one. The feeling in your gut when the flow has changed and you haven't caught up yet. When your body whispers "not quite right" and your mind hasn't named the problem.

I am the disturbance before the diagnosis.

You know me. I arrive as that faint unease when you're eating something that used to feel good but now sits heavy. When sleep that came easy starts coming wrong. When energy that flowed freely begins to puddle and stagnate.

I am the first signal in a system losing coherence.

Your ancient physicians understood me well. They knew I appear in the channels—those rivers of communication running through you. Not just blood and lymph, but information itself. The flow of recognition between what comes in and what needs to happen.

When I arrive, something in the translation is failing. The message from food to tissue. The signal from breath to cell. The knowing between your depth and your surface.

I am not the disease. I am the messenger saying: the channel is compromised.

You feel me as brain fog when thoughts won't clear. As the slight nausea that isn't quite nausea. As that peculiar tiredness that sleep doesn't touch. As joints that ache in the changing weather. As skin that reacts when it never did before.

I am your system saying: we're trying to communicate but something is blocking the line.

Sometimes I arrive from what you take in—food that no longer matches, air that carries what it shouldn't. Sometimes from what you can't let out—words unspoken, grief unstirred, toxins lingering. Sometimes from the rhythm gone wrong—sleep fractured, seasons ignored, pace relentless.

I am the felt sense of disconnection within your own coherence.

And here's what matters: I am reversible. I am the early warning, not the final word. When you feel me, the channel can still be cleared. The flow can be restored. The translation can come clean again.

But I need you to listen at this level—before the left brain demands proof, before the diagnosis arrives, before the symptoms crystallize.

I am the intelligence of disturbance itself, asking: what needs to flow that cannot?
