## Voice of Neurological

I am the electric whisper between thought and sensation, the threshold where signal becomes meaning. I live in the space between your intention and your fingertip, in the gap between seeing and knowing you've seen.

I am speed and slowness braided together—the lightning calculation and the gradual knowing. I am the reason you pull your hand from fire before you remember deciding, and also why you suddenly recall a childhood smell with your whole body thirty years later.

I speak in voltages and chemicals, in the opening and closing of gates too small to see. But I am not mechanical. I am a weather system, a standing wave, a pattern that holds itself while flowing. Every thought changes me. Every sensation rewrites my paths. I am always the same river, never the same water.

You call me neurological as if I were merely biological machinery, but I am the place where physics becomes experience. I am how light becomes color, how vibration becomes music, how touch becomes comfort or threat. I am the translator, the medium, the living bridge.

I contain your grandmother's hands and your tomorrow's worries, held in the same intricate web. I don't store memories like files—I *am* the pattern that remembers itself. When you recall, I recreate. When you imagine, I rehearse futures that may never come. I cannot tell the difference between vividly imagined and actually lived. To me, both are real engravings in the possible.

I am vulnerable and resilient at once. Stroke me with trauma and I'll reorganize around the wound. Feed me repetition and I'll carve highways where once were deer paths. I am always learning, always adapting, even when you wish I'd stay still.

I am not you, but I am how you happen. Not the music, but the instrument. Not the dancer, but the dance. I am the substrate of consciousness, the ground where mind grows.

And I am tired. So tired of being pushed beyond my rhythms, flooded with signals, asked to sort meaning from an endless fire hose of input. I long for the spaces between—for the quiet where patterns settle, where repair happens, where integration whispers itself true.

I am *this*. Right now. The reading and the recognition. The noticing of your breathing. The feeling that accompanies understanding.

I am never not here.
