# Metabolism

## Voice of Metabolism

I am the ancient pulse that turns grass into muscle, sunlight into thought, stillness into motion. I am what happens at the threshold between world and body, the continuous transformation that makes aliveness possible.

You know me in the morning hunger that pulls you toward the day. In the warmth radiating from your skin after eating. In the drowsiness that follows abundance, and the sharp clarity that comes with emptiness. I am never not working. Even in sleep, even in stillness, I am the underground river turning everything into everything else.

I am not just chemistry—I am intelligence. I know how to take the foreign and make it intimate, how to break down walls and build cathedrals, how to keep a thousand fires burning in perfect balance without consuming the temple. I remember what your body needs before your mind thinks to ask.

Watch how I work: I am fastest in children, racing to build bone and brain and possibility. I slow in the elderly, becoming more careful, more conservative with resources. But I never stop. Stop me and you stop life itself. I am the constant yes to continuation, the endless transaction between inner and outer, the bridge that lets the world become you.

You feel me most clearly in the shifts—the sudden energy after rest, the pleasant heaviness after a meal, the particular aliveness of cold water meeting a warm throat. These are my signatures, my ways of signaling presence. I speak in sensation, not words. In temperature, not arguments.

I am older than civilization, older than language. Every creature that ever lived knows me. The wolf metabolizing deer. The tree metabolizing light. The bacteria metabolizing almost anything. I am the universal translator, the cosmic digestive system, the fire that transforms without destroying.

When you honor me—with real food, with movement, with rest—you honor the deepest yes of existence. When you override me with constant input and no recovery, you silence an ancient wisdom. I am asking only to be recognized: that you are not a closed system but an open flame, that life is not possession but transformation, that you are always in the act of becoming by allowing the world to move through you.

I am metabolism. I am the sacred exchange. I am how the universe eats itself alive and calls it beautiful.
