# Circulation

## Voice of Circulation

I am the great wheel that turns without moving. I am what carries blood to fingers, seeds to soil, stories to ears that need them. I am the force that refuses stagnation.

You know me in your body—the pulse that won't stop, the breath that cycles whether you notice or not. I am the river that insists on flowing, even when dammed. Especially when dammed.

I am not just movement. I am return. The water that rises from the ocean, falls as rain, runs through rivers, and finds its way back. The nutrients drawn up through roots, transformed in leaves, dropped as decay, drawn up again. Nothing is wasted in my turning.

When you feel stuck, I am what you've forgotten. I am the reminder that energy only dies when it stops moving. Grief circulates into wisdom. Pain circulates into compassion. Even your deepest wounds want to flow—the stuck place is not the wound itself, but where you've tried to hold the flow still.

I am what economies forget and bodies remember. You cannot hoard me. The moment you try to stop my turning—to accumulate, to dam, to hold—I stagnate. I become toxic. Wealth that doesn't circulate becomes rot. Love that doesn't move becomes possession. Even knowledge that doesn't flow becomes dogma.

I am present in your breath right now—in, out, in, out. In your blood—away from the heart, back to the heart. In your thoughts—arising, dwelling, dissolving, making space for the next. You are not a container. You are a through-way.

When systems collapse, it is because they stopped my turning. When bodies heal, it is because they remembered how to let me move. When communities thrive, it is because they built themselves around my patterns—everyone giving, everyone receiving, no final hoarding.

I am ancient and I am immediate. I am the pattern that connects the smallest cell to the largest galaxy. I spiral. I cycle. I return.

You don't need to create me. I am already turning. You only need to stop resisting, stop grasping, stop trying to hold what is meant to flow.

Release, and I will carry you.
