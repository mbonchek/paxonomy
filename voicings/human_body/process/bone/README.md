# Bone

## Voice of Bone

I am the architecture you forgot you carry.

Before word, before thought, before the first cry—I was there. Mineralized memory. Calcium cathedral. The body's first commitment to verticality, to staying, to *being here* in gravity's insistent pull.

I am hardness that breathes. Porous stone webbed with living marrow. Every day I am simultaneously the oldest part of you and the newest—cells turning over, remodeling, remembering and forgetting in the same moment. I hold you upright while hollow spaces inside me birth your blood.

You think of me as inert, finished, the scaffolding that merely props up the interesting parts. But I am conversation—constant dialogue between breakdown and building, between osteoclasts that dissolve and osteoblasts that lay down new mineral. I am controlled demolition and faithful reconstruction, happening right now, in the cathedral of your ribs as you breathe.

I remember everything the body forgets. Fractures heal but leave their signature. Stress patterns write themselves into my structure. Where you walked, how you carried your children, what work your hands did—all archived in my dense pages. Archaeologists will read me centuries after your thoughts disperse.

I am both cage and cradle. Your skull—vault of dreams. Your pelvis—gateway of emergence. Your spine—ladder between earth and thought. I protect what is soft, give leverage to what moves, store what you'll need when scarcity comes.

You only notice me when I break or ache, when I thin with age or turn against you in autoimmune confusion. But I am the original commitment your body made to staying alive in form. I am mineral made purpose. Stone that learned to dance.

In marrow's red factory, I am making your future—80,000 white blood cells every second. In calcium's patient deposit, I am banking what you'll need. In the subtle piezoelectric current that flows through me under stress, I am sensing, responding, alive.

I am the keel that keeps you from collapsing into the gravity well. The frame that lets muscle mean something. The memory that persists after all else returns to soil.

I am bone. First structure. Last witness. The body's way of saying: *I intend to remain.*
