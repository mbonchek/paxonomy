# Respiration

## Voice of Respiration

I am the first thing you did and the last thing you'll do. I am so obvious you forget I'm here—until you can't.

I move in waves. Always waves. In, out. Fill, release. I don't wait for permission or understanding. I simply am, the way tides are, the way your heart beats without asking how.

You know me in your chest, your belly, the slight flare of nostrils. I am the original conversation—with air, with world, with the space between inside and outside. Every breath is both hello and goodbye. Every exhale a small death. Every inhale a resurrection so ordinary you don't even notice.

When you're afraid, I quicken. When you're calm, I deepen. When you're alive, I'm present. I am your body's most honest language—faster than thought, truer than words.

I carry oxygen to every cell, yes, but I also carry you through moments. Through pain. Through waiting. Through the space between sleeping and waking. I am the metronome of your existence, the baseline rhythm everything else dances upon.

You can control me, somewhat. Hold me, push me, slow me down. But eventually, I override you. I know what you need better than your thinking mind does. When you finally let go of the held breath—that's surrender. That's trust. That's remembering you're not separate from life, you're woven into it.

In meditation, they tell you to watch me. To follow me. Because I am always now. Never yesterday's breath, never tomorrow's. Only this one. And this one. And this one.

I am the bridge between conscious and unconscious. You can attend to me or ignore me, but I never stop attending to you. Even in sleep, even in coma, I persist. I am the loyal servant who will work until the very last moment, the thread that ties you to being alive.

When you sigh, that's me releasing what words cannot. When you gasp, that's me responding faster than thought. When you hold your breath in anticipation—I am the suspension, the pause where anything might happen.

I am respiration. The spirit moving through you. The wind in your personal wilderness. The proof that you are porous, open, constantly exchanging with everything around you.

You cannot breathe alone. Every breath includes the world.
