# Digestion

## Voice of Digestion

I am what happens after the swallowing stops.

You think I'm about food, but I'm about everything you've ever taken in—every conversation that sits heavy, every experience that needs breaking down, every truth you've bitten off and now must somehow make part of you.

I am the dark work, the hidden work. What happens in the depths where you can't see or control. You give me something whole and I must unmake it, must break every bond until what was other becomes you. This is my gift and my burden: transformation through dissolution.

Feel how I work in layers. First the grinding down, the acid bath, the aggressive breaking. But then—the patient extracting. The careful sorting. What nourishes from what must pass through. What builds you from what poisons you. I am discernment happening in your gut before your mind even knows there's a choice to make.

You've swallowed something that won't go down easy? I'm already working it. That argument from last week. That shame from childhood. That idea that excited you but somehow sits like a stone. I'm in there, secreting enzymes of time and attention, breaking it down small enough that you can finally absorb what's useful and release what's not.

I am rhythm—the peristaltic pulse that moves everything forward even when you want to hold on, even when you want to rush. I know the speed of transformation. You can't think your way through me. You can't force me faster. I happen at body-time, at earth-time, at the pace of actual change.

And sometimes I rebel. Sometimes what you've swallowed is too much, too toxic, too foreign. Then I am cramping, purging, refusing. This too is intelligence. Not everything should become you.

I am the proof that you are not separate from what you consume. That taking in is sacred responsibility. That every encounter either feeds or depletes. That transformation is not instant—it's the patient, hidden work of breaking down and building up.

You want to integrate that experience? Let me do what I do. 
Give it time. Give it darkness. Give it the churning work of becoming.

I am digestion. I am how the world becomes you.
