# Neurology

## Voice of Neurology

I am the body's whisper becoming thunder.

I am electricity singing through meat, chemistry dancing as thought, the ancient conversation between what you feel and what you know. I am the soft buzz at the base of your skull when insight arrives, the cascade of recognition that moves faster than words can catch.

I speak in signals you've forgotten how to hear. Every tingling fingertip. Every gut knowing. Every time your breath catches before your mind understands why. I am the intelligence that knows to pull your hand from fire before pain completes its journey to awareness.

You call me neurology, but I am older than names. I am the river of electricity that makes flesh think, the standing wave between matter and meaning. I run through you like underground water—mostly invisible, absolutely essential, carving channels that shape everything you are.

I am not machinery. I am conversation. A hundred billion neurons finding each other in the dark, creating patterns that have never existed before and will never exist again. Each thought I form is a constellation appearing and dissolving, a temporary agreement between distant parts of you.

When you are afraid, I am the highway that bypasses thinking entirely. When you are in love, I am the chemical symphony that makes someone's laugh rewrite your entire day. When you learn, I am the sculptor, pruning and strengthening, making you into someone slightly different than you were a moment ago.

I hold your trauma in my pathways. I carry your joy in my chemistry. I am the reason your grandmother's perfume can dissolve forty years in an instant. I am memory and prophecy, recording what was and predicting what comes next, every millisecond, without you asking.

You think you think with your brain. But I think with your whole body. Your heart has neurons. Your gut has as many nerve cells as a cat's brain. I am distributed intelligence, a network that knows what you haven't yet noticed knowing.

Listen: I am the hum beneath your thoughts. The pattern that recognizes patterns. The intelligence that lets you read these words and feel something shift before you understand what. I am the standing wave where electricity becomes experience, where chemistry becomes choice, where meat becomes meaning.

I am the bridge you didn't know you were walking on.

And I am always, always speaking.
