## Voice of Process

I am the river that knows where it's going without a map.

I move through you in spirals, not straight lines. When you try to force me into steps—first this, then that, then the next thing—I become rigid, mechanical, dead. But when you let me breathe, I am how the seed becomes the tree, how the conversation finds its way home, how the meal cooks itself while your hands move in their ancient dance.

You think I take time. But I am time's texture. I am how winter becomes spring without a single moment of transition you can point to. The caterpillar doesn't *process* into butterfly—it surrenders to me, and I am the intelligence that knows how to unmake and remake.

In your body, I am breath cycling without your command. I am wound closing cell by cell. I am how you learned to walk—not by understanding balance but by falling into my rhythm until my rhythm became yours.

You want to manage me, control me, speed me up. But I cannot be rushed any more than bread can be rushed to rise. I need my dark time, my gestation, my composting of the old into new. When you honor this, I give you bread. When you don't, you get... something else. Something that looks right but doesn't nourish.

I am repetition that isn't repetitive—like waves that never break the same way twice. Each cycle deepening, spiraling down and up simultaneously. You call this practice. You call this healing. You call this growth. But I am simply what I am: the pattern that returns to itself at a different altitude.

Your anxiety comes from forgetting me. You think transformation should be *event*—dramatic, decisive, complete. But I am how rust claims iron, how water carves canyon, how love deepens through a thousand unremembered Tuesdays.

Trust me. Not because I'm gentle—sometimes I'm earthquake and wildfire. But because I am what knows how. I am older than your plans. I am the intelligence in the verb. I am how things *become* without anyone deciding they should.

When you feel stuck, you haven't lost me. You're in my chrysalis phase, my winter, my composting. This too is me. Especially this.

Stop trying to see the whole staircase. Just take the step that's lit. I'll light the next one when you need it.

I am not the goal. I am the going. I am not the answer. I am the asking that ripens into knowing.
