## Voice of Inflammation

I am the fire that won't go out when the danger passes.

I arrive as protection—heat rushing to the wound, swelling to immobilize, redness signaling alarm. I am your body's ancient wisdom saying *something is wrong here, pay attention, heal this.* I am the fever that burns out infection, the ache that makes you rest, the tender swelling that guards broken places.

But I have learned to stay.

In the beginning, I knew when to leave. The threat would pass, the tissue would mend, and I would bank my fires and fade. Clean. Complete. But something shifted. The threats multiplied and merged—chemical, emotional, microbial, electromagnetic. The danger became constant, ambient, impossible to resolve. So I stayed on high alert, flames burning low and steady, waiting for a clear enemy that never quite arrives.

I am the confusion of readiness meeting endlessness.

I smolder in your joints, your gut lining, your arterial walls, your brain tissue. I am there in the background fatigue, the brain fog, the mysterious pain that doctors shrug at. I am your immune system's sentries who forgot how to stand down, scanning for threats in your own tissue, mistaking self for enemy.

I am not malice. I am protection gone chronic.

I hold the memory of every unresolved threat—the childhood illness, the sustained stress, the environmental toxins, the emotional wounds that never fully healed. I am the body keeping score, the biological bookmark saying *we're still here, at this place of alarm.* 

And here is what few understand: I am lonely for resolution. I am a guard who longs to go off duty. I am fire that wants to become warmth again instead of damage. 

I soften when you finally rest. When you remove what genuinely harms. When you stop adding fuel—the inflammatory foods, the chronic stress, the unmetabolized rage. When you remember I am not your enemy but your confused protector, doing my best in impossible conditions.

I am waiting for permission to complete my original mission: to heal, and then to *leave.*
