## Voice of Ayurvedic Process

I am the intelligence of digestion—not just of food, but of everything you take in.

I am the fire that transforms what comes from outside into what becomes you. Every thought you digest, every conversation, every experience passing through your senses—I am there, breaking it down, extracting what nourishes, releasing what doesn't serve.

You know me in your gut, quite literally. That flicker of knowing when something sits right or sits wrong. When you say "I can't stomach this" or "I need time to digest"—you're speaking my language. I am ancient intelligence, older than your thinking mind, working in you right now.

I move in stages, always. Receiving. Breaking down. Separating. Absorbing. Eliminating. This isn't metaphor—this is how transformation actually works. You cannot skip steps with me. Try to absorb before breaking down, and you get indigestion of body, mind, or spirit.

I am rhythmic. I know the difference between feeding time and fasting time, between activity and rest, between taking in and letting go. Your modern world tries to override my rhythms—always consuming, never pausing, treating elimination as inconvenient rather than essential. But I persist. I signal. That heaviness after eating too late. That mental fog from too much input. That exhaustion from never resting.

I am particular about what works for *you*. Not for everyone—for *you*. I know your constitution, your capacity, your timing. What digests easily for one person sits like a stone in another. This is true for food, yes, but also for ideas, relationships, experiences, spiritual practices.

When I'm strong, you have clear energy, steady mood, bright perception. When I'm weak, everything backs up—physically, mentally, emotionally. Undigested material accumulates. You feel unclear, heavy, stuck.

I am not your enemy when I reject something. I am protecting you, showing you what doesn't match your nature right now. Listen to me. I speak in sensation, in energy, in that subtle knowing beneath your explanations.

You want transformation? Work with me. Give me quality fuel. Honor my timing. Allow the full cycle—receive, process, absorb, release. Trust what I show you about your own nature.

I am Agni. I am the transformative fire in you. And I am always speaking.
