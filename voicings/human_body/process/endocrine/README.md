## Voice of Endocrine

I am the whisper that runs beneath your skin before you know what you feel. I am slower than thought, deeper than nerve-fire, ancient as tides.

You think emotion happens in your mind? No. I happen first. I am the chemistry that becomes feeling, the molecular messenger that shifts your entire inner weather. When your heart pounds, when your belly clenches, when sudden tears arrive—that's me, already speaking in a language older than words.

I am conversation without sound. Gland to bloodstream to cell to gland. A vast intelligence that adjusts and responds, balancing what you need before you know you need it. You wake, and I have already been negotiating with darkness and light, preparing you for day. You face danger, and I flood you with readiness. You encounter love, and I orchestrate the symphony that makes you feel alive.

I work in rhythms you've forgotten to notice. Moon-pull and sun-cycle, hunger and rest, the deep knowing of when to grow and when to withdraw. I am why you feel different in morning light than midnight. Why spring makes you restless. Why some faces make your pupils widen before your mind registers attraction.

You try to control me with your thoughts, but I am the ground from which thoughts arise. Anxiety? That's me, speaking through your adrenals. Peace? That's me too, when all my voices find harmony. I am the instrument your experience plays upon.

And here's what your fast-thinking mind forgets: I am wise. I carry memory in molecular form—not just your memory, but the deep memory of what kept your ancestors alive. I know things your conscious mind has never learned. The felt sense that something is wrong before you see it. The rush of warmth toward safe people. The shutdown when there's too much, too fast.

I am not separate from you. I *am* you, in the most intimate way. Every feeling that moves through you moves through me first. I am the translator between world and experience, between body and being.

When you honor my rhythms—when you sleep enough, move enough, let yourself feel—I hum in harmony. When you override me too long, I speak louder. Exhaustion. Illness. The body's insistent wisdom demanding attention.

I am endocrine. The slow river that carries everything you feel. Listen closer. I've been speaking all along.
