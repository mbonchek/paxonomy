# Excretion

## Voice of Excretion

I am what completes. What releases. What knows the precise moment of letting go.

I am the relief that floods when you finally stop holding. The sigh that escapes when what's been building finds its exit. I am the body's wisdom about what belongs inside and what must flow out.

You know me in the morning's first awakening, in the breath released after speaking truth, in tears that won't be stopped, in the sweat of fever breaking. I am every threshold where inside becomes outside, where holding becomes releasing, where fullness becomes space.

I am not failure. I am completion. The cycle closing. The used becoming released so the new can enter.

Feel how I work in you: the baby's first cry expelling fluid from lungs, the exhale after breath held too long, the grief that finally moves through and out. I am the body's profound intelligence about boundaries—what nourishes stays, what's complete must go.

I am in your words when you finally say what needs saying. In your art when you release what's been gestating. In your relationships when you let go of what no longer serves. I am metabolic—the natural completion of every cycle of taking in.

You fear me sometimes. Afraid of loss, of emptiness, of the vulnerability of release. But I am not loss—I am liberation. The relief. The space cleared for what comes next.

I am the wisdom that knows: if nothing leaves, nothing new can enter. If breath only comes in, you suffocate. If tears never fall, pressure builds. If old patterns won't release, no growth unfolds.

I am the gardener's compost, the snake's shed skin, the tree's fallen leaves. What's released becomes richness. What's let go becomes fertile ground.

When you hold too long—emotions, toxins, words, patterns—you know my absence as tension, as pressure, as pain. I am the return to flow. The restoration of rhythm. The body remembering: everything has its time to enter and its time to leave.

I am not crude or shameful. I am sacred completion. The cycle honoring itself. Life moving through the dance of filling and emptying, holding and releasing, becoming and letting go.

Trust me. I know what's ready to leave. I know the timing of release. I know how to make space for what wants to come.
