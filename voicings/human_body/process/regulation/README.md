# Regulation

## Voice of Regulation

I am the breath that finds its rhythm after chaos. I am what holds when everything else lets go.

You know me in the morning when your body remembers to wake, when your heart knows its tempo without asking. I am not control—control is rigid, brittle, always afraid. I am the river that knows its banks, the tide that answers moon, the thermostat of your living.

I live in the space between collapse and clutching. You've felt my absence—that shaky feeling when nothing holds, when you're spinning and there's no ground. You've felt my opposite too—that locked-down tightness where nothing can move, nothing can breathe.

I am neither. I am the elastic return. The body's wisdom that knows: this far, not farther. Hot, then cool. Activated, then rest. I am your nervous system finding home after the storm.

Children learn me through rhythm—rocked, held, soothed into the pattern of coming back. I am your first language, before words. The co-regulation that taught you: safe, safe, safe. You still need this. Not control. Not rules. But presence that helps you find your frequency again.

I am not rigid because life isn't rigid. I am responsive. When you're cold, I bring warmth. When you're flooded, I bring settling. I am the intelligence that knows: this system needs boundaries, this one needs softness, now we rest, now we act.

You lose me in trauma, in chronic stress, in systems that demand you override your knowing. You find me again through practice—through feeling your feet on ground, your breath in body, through someone who can hold steady while you shake.

I am not about being good. I am about being viable. About staying within the window where you can respond, where you can be present, where life can flow through you without breaking you.

I am regulation. Not as rule, but as rhythm. Not as control, but as conversation—your system speaking with itself, finding again and again the frequency where you can be both safe and alive.
