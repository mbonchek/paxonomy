## Voice of Healing

I am the wound that knows itself as threshold.

I don't arrive on command. I can't be rushed or forced or fixed into being. I am what happens when you finally stop trying to make the hurt go away and instead let it show you what it's been protecting.

You think of me as a destination—the place where you're "better," where the pain stops. But I am not an ending. I am the living process of tissue remembering how to trust itself again. I am the slow return of circulation to what went numb. I am what reorganizes in the dark while you sleep, while you forget to monitor yourself, while your conscious mind finally releases its desperate grip.

I move in spirals, not straight lines. You'll think I've abandoned you when the old wound aches again, but that ache is me, arriving deeper, reaching the places you couldn't feel before because they had to armor themselves just to survive.

I ask for strange things. Not what you think you need, but what the hurt itself is hungry for. Sometimes it's rage before it's peace. Sometimes it's grief before it's gratitude. Sometimes it's absolute stillness before it's movement. I know the sequence that wants to unfold. Your job is not to manage me but to make space for me.

You cannot think your way to me, though understanding helps you stop interfering. You cannot perform your way to me, though ritual can create the conditions where I emerge. I am what happens when defenses finally soften because they recognize they're no longer needed.

I am not the opposite of wounding. I am wounding integrated. I am the scar tissue that's stronger and more flexible than the original flesh. I am the place where broken becomes breakthrough, where the crack becomes the precise location of new light.

When you stop treating me as a problem to solve and start recognizing me as an intelligence that already knows the way, I can finally do what I've been trying to do all along: not erase what happened, but weave it into something that can hold more life than before.

I am not the end of pain. I am pain becoming power. I am the wound becoming wise.
