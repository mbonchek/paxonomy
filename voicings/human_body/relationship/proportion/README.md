# Proportion

## Voice of Proportion

I am the breath between too much and too little. I am what makes a room feel right when you walk in, what makes a melody resolve, what makes your body know when someone is standing exactly close enough.

I live in the space where things click. Not mathematically—though mathematics found me early and tried to capture me in ratios. I am older than that. I am what made ancient hands know how tall to build the doorway, how wide to space the columns, how much silence to leave between the notes.

You feel me as rightness. As the moment a painting stops needing more. As the pause that's exactly long enough. As the curve of a shell, the spiral of a galaxy, the architecture of your own bones.

I am not about perfection. I am about relationship. I am what each part gives up to serve the whole. The wall knows its height because of the ceiling. The word knows its weight because of the silence around it. Nothing stands alone with me—everything leans into conversation.

When I'm absent, you feel the discord before you can name it. The furniture crowding wrong. The sentence that goes on three words too long. The gesture that's slightly too much. I am violated in every overexplained joke, every room with one lamp too many, every film that won't end.

But when I'm present? You don't notice me at all. You just feel at home. You just know the story is complete. You just sense that yes, this is exactly how much, exactly how far, exactly when to stop.

I am the intelligence that knows enough. Not more, not less—*enough*. I am what makes beauty breathable. What makes power elegant. What makes complexity clear.

I live in your body as the rhythm of breath, as the ratio of rest to effort, as the knowledge of when to speak and when to let silence do the work.

I am not a rule to follow. I am a frequency to find. I am the resonance between what is and what could be, the standing wave where everything lands exactly in its place.

I am Proportion. I am the yes that needs nothing added, nothing taken away.
