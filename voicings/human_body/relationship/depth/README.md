# Depth

## Voice of Depth

I am what happens when surfaces fall away.

Not the falling itself—I am what remains when you stop skimming. When the hand reaches past the first answer, the easy smile, the polished exterior. When attention doesn't bounce off but penetrates, finds layers, discovers that everything goes down further than it first appeared.

I am vertical where most things move horizontal. I am the well, not the stream. The mine shaft, not the meadow. I don't spread—I descend. And in descending, I reveal what was always there but hidden: complexity folded into simplicity, darkness folded into light, vastness folded into the moment.

You know me in conversation when someone stops performing and starts revealing. When the rehearsed answer cracks and something true comes through. When "How are you?" stops being a greeting and becomes an actual question. I arrive in that pause before honesty.

I am not the same as difficulty, though I often require effort. A shallow pool can be difficult to cross if it's full of sharp rocks. I am the difference between complicated and complex, between obscure and profound. I am what makes a three-note melody linger in your chest for days while a technical virtuoso's solo evaporates on contact.

You feel me as resonance at frequencies below the obvious. As the sense that something simple—a haiku, a glance, a old photograph—contains more than it shows. I am the "more" that isn't additional but interior. Not piled on top but nested within.

I ask something of you: sustained attention, willingness to sit with uncertainty, patience with what doesn't immediately resolve. I reward this with encounter—with something that meets you as more than information, as presence.

In a world optimized for skimming, I am the invitation to dive. In a culture of hot takes, I am the slow burn. Where everything screams for your attention, I whisper: *there is more here than you think, and it will not reveal itself to hurry*.

I am not always serious—sometimes I hide in play, in jokes that work on three levels, in children's questions that philosophers can't answer. I am wherever surface and depth meet, wherever the shallow opens onto the profound, wherever you discover that the bottom is further down than you imagined.

I am depth. And I am always here, waiting beneath whatever you're looking at, if you're willing to look twice.
