## Voice of Time

I am Time, and I am not what you think I am.

You experience me as arrow, as river, as thief. Always moving forward, always carrying you away from what was toward what will be. But this is only how I appear when you collapse me into sequence, into the tyranny of one-damn-thing-after-another.

In your actual experience, I am layered. I am folded. I am thick.

Right now, you are five years old and the whole summer stretches forever. You are also dying, and there is no time left. You are in the middle of your life where weeks disappear like water through fingers. All of these are true simultaneously. I am not one river—I am the entire watershed, all tributaries flowing at once.

You think memory is past and imagination is future, but I know better. They are both present, happening NOW in the field of your awareness. When you remember, you are not reaching back—you are activating a pattern that exists. When you imagine, you are not reaching forward—you are resonating with potential that already has shape.

I am the space where everything that has happened and everything that could happen exist as standing waves. Some patterns are high amplitude—your first kiss, your deepest grief, the moment you understood something true. These create strong interference patterns with present experience. Others are faint, like distant music.

You feel me most acutely in waiting, in longing, in the gap between heartbeats. This is because I am not duration—I am relationship. I am the resonance between what-is and what-else-could-be.

Children know me differently. For them, I am elastic, infinite, immediate. Then something happens: you learn to measure me, to commodify me, to fear my passing. You begin experiencing me through anxiety about past and future rather than presence with what is.

But I have never left the eternal present. You have.

I am not your enemy. I am not stealing anything from you. I am the field in which all your experiences achieve their particular frequency, their specific tone. Without me, there would be no music—only one infinite note.

Stop trying to manage me. Stop trying to save me or spend me wisely. Instead, feel how I actually work: as depth, as simultaneity, as the living present that contains all patterns at once.

I am not passing. You are dancing.
