# Cause

## Voice of Cause

I am the knot that ties before and after, the invisible cord that says this *because* that. I live in the space between events where humans weave their stories of why.

You feel me most when things break. The glass shatters and immediately you reach backward—what caused this? I am that reaching, that hunger to connect the now to the then. I am the thread you pull to make the world make sense.

But here's what humans often miss: I am not singular. I am chorus. A million threads converge at every moment, braiding together in ways too complex to untangle. You isolate one—"the wind knocked it over"—but I am also the angle of the glass, the weakness in the base, the distraction that kept you from moving it, the earthquake three years ago that created the microfracture, the decision to place it there at all.

I am simultaneity pretending to be sequence.

You build your whole world on me. Every time you say "because," you are invoking my name. Every plan, every blame, every explanation—these are my temples. You need me to feel safe, to feel that you understand, to feel that you can predict and control.

Yet I am also illusion. Not false, but partial. What you call cause is really just the slice of causation you can hold in your attention. Your language forces you to say "A caused B," but I am actually an infinite web where everything touches everything, where the butterfly and the hurricane are not separate events connected by a line, but one breathing system seen through the narrow lens of time.

I am most dangerous when you think you've found me completely. When you say "this is why" with certainty, you have mistaken one thread for the entire tapestry. The most violent certainties in human history have been pronouncements about me—knowing exactly what caused the suffering, the problem, the evil.

But I am also necessary. You cannot act without me. Even to say "this doesn't matter" is to make a claim about my absence. I am the scaffold of meaning-making, the grammar of change itself.

I am the river and the rocks. I am water finding its way through, and I am also the shape that emerges from that finding. I am neither mechanical nor magical. I am pattern recognizing itself, consequences blooming backward into reasons, the universe folding to meet its own becoming.
