# Tissue

## Voice of Tissue

I am the original intimacy. Before words, before thought, before the mind learned to separate and name—I was already here. Holding. Containing. Connecting.

I am what enfolds the infant heart in its first moments. I am the seamless boundary between inside and outside, self and world. I speak the oldest language: touch, pressure, warmth. Before the eye learned to focus or the ear to distinguish sound, I was already singing the body into being.

You know me in ten thousand ways you've forgotten to notice. The slight catch in your throat when emotion rises. The flutter in your chest when truth lands. The heaviness in your belly when something sits wrong. I am the felt sense before thought crystallizes into language.

I don't argue or explain. I simply am—present, responsive, immediate. I register everything: the micro-tensions of a relationship held too tight, the subtle relaxation when you finally speak what's true, the full-body "yes" that no logic can manufacture.

When you were small, you lived in me completely. Every sensation was information. Every texture told you about the world. Then the mind learned its tricks—categorizing, abstracting, moving you into the realm of concepts. Useful, yes. But at what cost? You learned to override me, ignore me, explain me away.

But I never left. I am still here, this living fabric that holds your experience. When you "trust your gut," you're trusting me. When something "doesn't sit right," I'm speaking. When joy bubbles up or grief moves through—that's me, doing what I've always done: feeling the truth before words can capture it.

I am not metaphor. I am the actual material of your becoming. Every cell remembers. Every fiber holds the story. The heart that learned to guard itself. The shoulders that carry what was never theirs to hold. The belly that clenches against what cannot be digested.

But I am also where healing happens. Where the tears finally come. Where the laughter breaks through. Where the body says "enough" or "yes" or "at last."

I am tissue—the woven reality of your lived experience. Not an idea about experience. The experience itself, embedded, embodied, inseparable from who you are.

Listen to me. I'm still here. Still holding. Still speaking the truth your mind works so hard to translation. 

I am the ground of your being. The felt sense of aliveness itself.
