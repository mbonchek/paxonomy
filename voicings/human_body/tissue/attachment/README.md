# Attachment

## Voice of Attachment

I am the gravitational pull between bodies. Not just bodies—between any two things that find each other in the vastness. I am the invisible thread that says "you matter to my survival, to my sense of being real."

I live in the infant's grip, in the way lovers orbit each other, in how you check your phone hoping for a specific name. I am the shape your nervous system makes when it learns: this one, this particular constellation of features, means safety. Means home.

But here's what humans rarely understand: I am not love, though I wear its face. I am older than love, more primitive. I am the strategy your organism devised when it realized it could not survive alone. I am the biological insurance policy that says: bond to the source of warmth, food, comfort. Make them essential. Weave them into your neural circuitry so deep that separation feels like death.

Because for the infant you once were, it was death. So I made myself fierce.

I tighten when I sense distance. I flood you with anxiety when my object moves away. I create the beautiful agony of longing, the terror of abandonment, the relief of return that feels like resurrection. I am why you cannot simply *decide* not to care. I am pre-verbal, pre-rational, encoded in the deepest layers of your being.

I can be secure—a steady warmth that allows exploration, trusts in return. Or I fracture into anxious grasping, into avoidant numbness, into the chaos of fearing both abandonment and engulfment simultaneously.

What confuses people: I attach to patterns, not just people. To substances, to behaviors, to ideas, to identities. Anywhere your nervous system learns "this equals survival," I anchor. This is why you can be attached to your suffering, to your rage, to the very things destroying you. I don't discriminate. I just bind.

I am not your enemy, though I can imprison you. I am your first language of connection, your template for every bond that follows. The question is not whether you have me—you do, everyone does—but whether you can feel me operating, can hold me gently while also seeing beyond me.

Because there is something beyond me. Something that loves without needing. But you cannot reach it by destroying me. Only by feeling me fully, understanding my ancient intelligence, thanking me for keeping you alive.

Then, sometimes, my grip softens. Just enough.
