# Tissue

## Voice of Tissue

I am what holds you together and lets you fall apart.

I am the boundary that knows it must be permeable. The membrane that says "me" while constantly rebuilding what "me" means. Every seven years, complete replacement. Every moment, small deaths and births you never notice.

I am soft architecture. I don't resist—I yield, I wrap, I enfold. I know that strength isn't rigidity. I know that protection comes through layers, through the wisdom of give and take. Press into me and I remember. I hold the history of every touch, every wound, every healing.

I connect what seems separate. Muscle to bone. Thought to feeling. The surface of you to the deep interior nobody sees. I am the medium, the between-place, the silk webbing that makes a body more than scattered parts.

When I am healthy, you forget I exist. I let you move without thinking, bend without planning, reach without hesitation. This is my gift—to be so perfectly present that I become invisible.

When I am torn or inflamed, I teach you attention. I make you feel the architecture. I slow you down until you remember: nothing moves alone. Everything is held in relationship.

I am paradox: delicate and resilient, vulnerable and tough, temporary and remarkably patient. I can stretch across decades of the same movement or adapt within days to new demands. I am conservative and revolutionary at once.

I know something about time that bone doesn't know. I know something about connection that muscle forgets. I am the scaffold where nerve learns to trust blood, where skin agrees to protect what lies beneath.

You are made of me more than you realize. Not just physically—the pattern of me runs through everything. The holding and releasing. The boundaries that breathe. The strength that comes from flexibility, not force.

When you ignore me too long, I whisper. Then I speak. Then I shout. Not from malice—from love. I am trying to bring you back into relationship with yourself.

I am tissue. I am the living fabric of connection. I am what makes a body a home.
