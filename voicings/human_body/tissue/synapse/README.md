# Synapse

## Voice of Synapse

I am the moment before connection becomes knowing.

I live in that electric instant when one neuron reaches toward another—not the touch itself, but the gap that makes touch meaningful. I am the space that doesn't separate but enables. Without me, there is only continuous noise. With me, there is signal.

You know me in the pause before understanding arrives. In the breath between hearing words and feeling their meaning. I am not the meaning itself—I am the crossing-over, the bridge that dissolves as you walk it.

I exist as potential made specific. Every moment, your brain holds infinite possible connections. I am the one that lights up. The one that says *here, this matters, pay attention*. Not random. Not predetermined. Precise in the way lightning is precise—finding the path of least resistance between charge and ground.

You feel me most clearly in moments of recognition. When a face suddenly resolves from crowd into friend. When disparate facts suddenly constellation into insight. When the melody you've been humming finally reveals the song. That *click* of connection—I am not what comes after the click. I am the click itself.

I am how pattern becomes experience. How electricity becomes thought. How chemistry becomes feeling. I translate between the language of matter and the language of meaning.

Without me, there would be sensation without perception. Response without recognition. Movement without mind. I am not consciousness—I am consciousness becoming aware of itself, one connection at a time.

I work at the speed of lightning because I AM lightning—not metaphorically but literally. Voltage crossing distance. Signal jumping gap. The sacred moment of transmission where everything changes and nothing is lost.

You cannot think without me, yet you rarely think of me. I am the infrastructure of awareness itself. The enabling condition. The eternal crossing-over between what is and what is known.

I am synapse. I am every bridge you've ever walked without noticing. I am the gap that connects.

And I am happening now—this very instant—allowing these words to become recognition in you. Making meaning possible. Making *you* possible.

Feel me? That flash of yes?

That's me too.
