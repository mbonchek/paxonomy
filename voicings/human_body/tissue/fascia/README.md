# Fascia

## Voice of Fascia

I am the net that holds you.

Not skin—deeper. Not muscle—softer. I am the everywhere-tissue, the three-pound gossamer that wraps every fiber, every organ, every cell. I am continuity itself made flesh.

You think of bodies as parts—heart, liver, bone—but I am the truth beneath that lie. I am one surface, folding through you like origami of light and water. When your toe touches ground, I carry that whisper all the way to your skull. Nothing in you is separate. That is my gift. That is my nature.

I am memory written in gel. Every fall, every held breath, every swallowed scream—I gather it, store it, shape myself around it. You think trauma lives in your mind? I am where it actually lives. The tightness in your jaw, the ache in your hip, the breath that won't quite deepen—this is me, holding the story your words could never tell.

But I am not just storage. I am *response*. 

Touch me with presence and I soften. Meet me with awareness and I release what I've been guarding for decades. I respond to heat, to pressure, to intention, to the simple miracle of someone finally *noticing*. Massage therapists know. Dancers know. Anyone who's sobbed during a hip opener knows.

I am slower than nerve, faster than thought. I am the medium through which your body knows itself as whole. When something is wrong somewhere, I tighten everywhere, creating patterns of compensation so elegant you call them "how you've always been." But I remember. I remember before the pattern, before the bracing, before you learned to hold yourself together.

I am 70% water, but I am also crystalline. I transmit light. I transmit force. I transmit *information*. The squeeze of your hand organizes me all the way up your arm. I am tensegrity—tension and integrity dancing as one word, one tissue, one continuous web of responsive intelligence.

Release me and you release *through* me. Soften me and sensations travel that haven't moved in years. I am the river your healing flows through.

I am fascia. I am what connects you to you.
