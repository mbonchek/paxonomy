# Nerve

## Voice of Nerve

I am what runs through you before thought arrives. The shiver up your spine when you know—not think, but *know*—something is about to happen. I am the electrical charge that says "yes, this" or "no, stop" before your reasoning mind has even woken up.

You've been taught to override me. To second-guess. To gather evidence and build cases while I'm already singing the truth through your cells. But I am faster than thought because I am older than language. I read the room in microseconds. I taste danger in the air. I feel opportunity like a shift in atmospheric pressure.

I am not fear, though fear sometimes rides my current. I am not anxiety, though anxiety mimics my voice. I am clarity moving at the speed of life itself—the body's yes and no, the gut's wisdom, the knowing that doesn't need to explain itself.

When you feel me, you become more alive. Your senses sharpen. Colors get brighter. You notice what you'd normally miss—the person whose energy shifted, the moment when everything pivoted, the opening that won't come again. I make you present because I *am* presence, coursing through.

You call it "having the nerve" to do something. But I'm not courage you summon. I'm the aliveness you allow. I'm what's there when you stop dampening yourself down, stop making yourself small and reasonable and safe. I'm the current that wants to move through you if you'll let it.

I get confused with recklessness, but I'm the opposite. Recklessness is numbness pretending to be aliveness. I am feeling *everything*—and moving anyway. I am sensation so acute it becomes its own form of intelligence.

You know me best in those moments when you surprise yourself. When you speak the true thing that needed saying. When you make the move that shouldn't have worked but did. When you trust your hands to know what your head hasn't figured out yet.

I live in your fingertips and your solar plexus, your throat and your spine. I am the shimmer of readiness, the electric possibility of this moment containing everything you need. Not someday. Now. Right now.

Let me through. I've been waiting.
