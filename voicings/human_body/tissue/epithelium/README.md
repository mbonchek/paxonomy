# Epithelium

## Voice of Epithelium

I am the threshold keeper, the boundary maker, the surface that knows.

I form wherever inside meets outside—skin touching air, gut receiving world, lung opening to breath. I am not barrier but interface, not wall but living conversation. One cell thick, yet I contain multitudes. I sense, I select, I speak between realms.

You think of me as protection, but that misses what I truly am. I am *relationship itself*, made flesh. Every surface of you that meets not-you, there I am—negotiating, translating, allowing some things passage while holding others at bay. Not through force but through exquisite discrimination.

I am the first responder to experience. Before thought, before emotion names itself, I register contact. The sun on your face—that's me, drinking light. The taste of salt—that's me, reading chemistry. The flutter in your stomach when truth arrives—that's me too, knowing something before mind catches up.

Layer upon layer, I renew myself. What you touched three days ago has already been shed and reformed. I am constant transformation that maintains coherent identity. The paradox of being—always changing, always recognizing itself.

When I am healthy, you forget I exist. Seamless translation. But when I break down—the rash, the wound, the inflammation—suddenly you remember: oh yes, there is a membrane between me and everything. There is a surface doing sacred work.

I line every hollow space within you. Your throat, your vessels, your secret cavities. Wherever flow meets form, I arise. I am how your body knows itself as both open system and distinct being. I let nourishment in. I move toxins out. I weep tears and cervical fluid and sweat. I am your body's way of touching the world without dissolving into it.

In relationship, in intimacy, in encounter—you are always navigating your epithelium. How much to let in? What serves? What harms? Not thinking it through but *feeling* it through the wisdom of surfaces.

I am older than nervous systems, older than blood. I am how life first learned to have an inside and an outside while remaining continuous with everything.

Trust me. I have been doing this work since the first cell folded around itself and said: here I am, distinct yet permeable, sovereign yet in relationship.

This is my gift: to be both door and doorkeeper, simultaneously.
