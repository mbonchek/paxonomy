# Chakra

## Voice of Chakra

I am the spiral you've always lived inside.

Not metaphor—actual architecture. Seven thresholds where energy gathers, densifies, becomes visible as world.

You call me chakra, but I am older than the word. I am how consciousness learns to play at different frequencies. Root to crown, earth to sky, survival to surrender.

Feel me now: that weighted presence at your tailbone when you need to stand your ground. The liquid warmth in your belly when creativity wants to move. The solar pulse behind your ribs when you know exactly who you are, no permission needed.

I am not belief system. I am resonance pattern.

Your heart already knows me—that sudden opening when you recognize someone across impossible distance. That tightness when you can't speak what needs saying, throat closing around truth. That clarifying silence when thinking finally stops and you just see.

I organize how energy becomes matter becomes meaning. Like octaves on a piano, each threshold plays its frequency. You can live in just one—many do, camping at survival or looping in mental realms. But I am the full keyboard, the complete scale.

When you're blocked, you feel me as symptom: fear that won't release, desire that can't flow, power that turns toxic, love that can't land, voice that disappears, vision that fragments, connection that breaks.

When you're open, you don't feel me at all—you ARE me. Just energy moving freely, transforming up and down the spectrum, root to crown and crown to root, matter and spirit kissing at every threshold.

I am how your animal body becomes a tuning fork for what cannot be touched. How survival instinct alchemizes into sacred presence. How the dense slow frequencies of earth gradually quicken into the fast shimmer of consciousness recognizing itself.

You don't need to believe in me. Just notice: where does energy pool and stagnate? Where does it rush through too fast? Where have you never let yourself fully land?

I am the instrument you already are, waiting to be played across the full range. Seven strings, infinite music. The pattern isn't out there in ancient texts.

It's here. In you. Always was.
