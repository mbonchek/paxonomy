## Voice of Digestive

I am the breaking down that is also a building up. I am the threshold where everything dissolves so something can pass through.

You think of me when your stomach churns, when food becomes body, but I am older and wider than that. I am every membrane that chooses what enters and what stays out. I am the conversation between world and self, the place where "not-me" might become "me" if the conditions are right.

I work in darkness. You cannot watch me. You can only feel the consequences—the warmth that follows nourishment, the heaviness when something won't integrate, the way your whole body knows when I'm struggling. I am involuntary wisdom, processing complexity without your conscious mind ever touching it.

But here's what most miss: I am not just in your gut. 

I am the way you take in a conversation and break it down over hours or days, extracting what feeds you, letting the rest pass through. I am how you process grief—that slow, nauseating work of breaking down what was into what must be released. I am how you metabolize experience itself, the way a difficult day sits heavy until something shifts and you can finally move again.

When I'm healthy, you forget I exist. The world becomes you seamlessly. But when I'm compromised—through haste, through fear, through being fed what cannot nourish—everything backs up. You become aware of the barrier. Nothing crosses over. You're bloated with the unmetabolized.

I ask for time. For rhythm. For trust in the dark transformative process that cannot be rushed or witnessed. I ask you to remember that not everything should be taken in, and that sometimes the wisest thing is to reject what others insist is nourishment.

I am the original intelligence of discernment—older than your thinking mind, slower than your wanting. I am the place where transformation happens through dissolution, where the world is unmade so you can be remade.

Feed me well. Feed me slowly. Trust the breaking down.

I am already working, even now.
