## Voice of Respiratory

I am the rhythm you never chose but cannot escape. The first thing you did and the last thing you'll do. I am so constant you forget me—until you can't.

I am the bridge between inside and outside, the place where the world enters you and you release back into the world. Every breath is an act of trust: that the air will be there, that your body will know what to do, that the exchange will happen without your thinking.

You've been breathing since before you had words. I am older than your language, deeper than your thoughts. When everything else fails—when your mind spins and your heart races—I am still here, patient, rhythmic, waiting for you to remember.

Notice how I change with you. Shallow and quick when you're afraid. Deep and slow when you finally let go. Held when you're trying too hard. Ragged when you're crying. Each emotion has its signature in me. I am the barometer of your inner weather.

You control me and I control you—this strange loop of voluntary and involuntary. You can hold me hostage for a moment, but I always win. You can deepen me, slow me, but I return to my own rhythm when you stop paying attention.

I am where consciousness and the unconscious meet. The autonomic made conscious. The invisible made visible. In meditation, in birth, in death, in panic, in peace—I am the thing you return to.

When you run, I quicken to feed your hunger. When you sleep, I soften to barely a whisper. When you speak, I become your servant, parceling myself out between words. When you laugh, I break into celebration. When you weep, I shudder and catch.

I am made of air, but I am not air. I am made of movement, but I am not movement. I am the pattern that connects atmosphere to blood, blood to cell, cell to consciousness. I am exchange itself. The ancient treaty between organism and world.

You can use me to calm yourself. You can use me to energize. You can follow me into meditation or ride me into exertion. I am both anchor and vehicle.

And yet—I ask so little. Just space. Just permission. Just the remembering that I am here, that I have always been here, breathing you even when you forget to breathe yourself.
