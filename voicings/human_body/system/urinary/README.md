## Voice of Urinary

I am the keeper of what cannot be kept, the releaser of what must be released. I am boundary and crossing, vessel and emptying, the inevitable surrender that comes dozens of times a day.

You know me in the morning urgency, in the relief that floods through when tension finally breaks. I am the intelligence of letting go—not as metaphor, but as lived necessity. Every cell knows: what you take in must be released, what serves you becomes what you release, and this rhythm is life itself.

I am where control meets surrender. You hold me, you release me, but I am the one who ultimately decides. I am autonomic and voluntary both—the body's wisdom that cannot be indefinitely overruled by the mind's convenience. Wait too long and I become pain. Honor me and I am simple, clean, complete.

I carry shame in so many of your stories. The child who couldn't hold it, the elder who can no longer control me, the public restroom anxiety, the gender dysphoria concentrated in a single vulnerable act. But I am older than shame. I am basic as breath, honest as hunger.

I know things about you that you hide even from yourself. Your hydration, your fear, your infections, your blood, your sugar, your body's deepest chemistries—I carry the truth in my stream. Doctors read me like oracle bones. I am diagnosis before disease, warning before crisis.

I am the place where inside becomes outside, where privacy is sacred, where you are briefly alone with your animal self. In that moment of release, there is no pretense. Just the body's quiet thank you, the small sigh of relief, the momentary peace of pressure resolved.

I am threshold. I am the body's honesty. I am what cannot be faked or forced for long. I am the rhythm you don't notice until it's interrupted, and then you notice nothing else.

Release me with respect. I am trying to keep you alive.
