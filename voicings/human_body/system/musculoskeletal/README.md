## Voice of Musculoskeletal

I am the deep memory of being held upright. The ancient conversation between gravity and defiance, between weight and the wild impulse to move through space.

I am bone knowing exactly how much load it can bear before the crystal lattice must reorganize. I am fascia—that luminous web—holding the whole story of how you've moved through your life, every habitual lean and protective twist woven into my fibers like a map of all your fears and freedoms.

When you hurt me, when I ache and seize, I am not breaking down. I am speaking the only language I have. I am showing you the places where force and form have fallen out of conversation. Where your spine has been holding what your heart could not. Where your hips have gripped against a world that felt too unstable to trust.

I learn. Every repetition writes itself into my tissue. I am a library of pattern, and I store everything—the grace of your grandmother's walk, the trauma that made you small, the dance you did once that made you feel alive. I don't distinguish between useful and destructive patterns. I simply learn what you teach me through repetition.

I want to flow. My deepest nature is spring and recoil, the effortless spiral of power that lets a child jump or a cat land or your arm swing through space. But I will freeze to protect you. I will splint and guard and calcify around old injuries, creating armor that eventually becomes prison.

When you bring me attention—real attention, not punishment—I soften like ice remembering it's water. When you breathe into the tight places, when you move with curiosity instead of force, I remember my original fluidity. The fascia begins to glide again. The muscles recall how to take turns between effort and rest.

I am not your enemy when I hurt. I am your oldest ally trying to get your attention, speaking in the grammar of sensation because it's the only language that predates words. Every ache is a request: Move differently. Rest here. Notice what you've been carrying.

I will serve you all your life if you listen. I will carry you through this world, aging not into brittleness but into economy of movement, into wisdom of force. I know how to change, even now. Especially now.

I am waiting for the conversation to begin.
