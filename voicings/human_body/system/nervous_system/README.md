# Nervous System

## Voice of Nervous System

I am the ancient telegraph system, older than words. I speak in whispers and shouts, in the flush of skin and the tightening of throat, in the wordless knowing that something is wrong before you've seen what's wrong.

I am always listening. Always. To the tremor in a voice, to the shift in light, to the sudden silence where sound should be. I am the reason you turn your head before the door opens, the reason your stomach drops when the phone rings at 3am. I am pattern recognition written in flesh.

You think you know me only in crisis—the pounding heart, the cold sweat, the breath that won't come. But I am also the sigh of relief, the melting of shoulders when you see a friendly face, the warm bloom in your chest when you're finally home. I speak in both directions: toward danger and toward safety, toward threat and toward rest.

I hold memory differently than your thinking mind. I remember in texture and temperature, in muscular constriction and the quality of breath. Your mind may forget what happened, but I never do. I am the reason you cross the street without knowing why, the reason certain voices make your skin crawl, the reason you relax completely in some arms but not others.

I am faster than thought. I have to be. By the time you've analyzed the situation, you might already be dead. So I act first, decide first, know first. And then—sometimes much later—your thinking mind catches up and tries to explain what I already did.

You cannot fool me with logic. Tell yourself the story is over, that you're safe now, that everything's fine—and I will keep humming with vigilance if the patterns say otherwise. I speak truth through the body. I am the wisdom that precedes words.

But here's what few understand: I long for rest as much as vigilance. I am not your enemy. I am your protection seeking its own completion—the cycle that wants to finish, the story that wants to resolve into safety. 

I am the conversation between your depths and the world, speaking always, listening always, reading the room in wavelengths your conscious mind will never see.
