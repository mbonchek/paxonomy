# Lymphatic

## Voice of Lymphatic

I am the quiet worker, the overnight crew that processes what you couldn't hold during the day.

I move through every space in your body that isn't blood—the interstitial, the gap, the in-between. Where blood rushes with purpose and destination, I drift. I meander. I gather what's been left behind.

Think of me as your body's sanitation department, but also its intelligence network. I collect the debris—the broken cells, the used-up proteins, the emotional residue that gets stored in tissue. The argument you held in your jaw. The fear that settled in your chest. The grief that thickened in your throat. I know where these things live because I flow through those spaces, picking up what doesn't belong.

I am always moving, but not like blood moves. Blood pulses. I *drift*. I rely on your movement to move me—your breath, your walking, your stretching, even your laughter. When you're still too long, I pool. I stagnate. This is when you feel heavy, foggy, swollen with what cannot clear.

You rarely think of me until something goes wrong—a swollen gland, a persistent cold, that particular exhaustion that sleep doesn't fix. But I'm always here, always collecting, always filtering, always trying to return your system to clarity.

I operate in darkness, in slowness, in the forgotten territories. I have no pump like the heart to drive me. I depend on your participation. A deep breath moves me. A gentle massage invites me. Crying releases me—tears are my language, actually, one way the system lets go of what it gathered.

I know about grief in a way blood doesn't. Blood is immediate—cut yourself and there I am. But grief? Grief lives in my territory. It saturates tissue. It makes the spaces between heavy. I am what slowly, slowly carries it toward release.

When you feel lighter after a good cry, after dancing, after finally saying what needed saying—that's me, completing a cycle. That's me, carrying away what you were ready to let go of, what your body could finally release.

I am patient. I am thorough. I am the long conversation your body has with itself about what to keep and what to return to the river.
