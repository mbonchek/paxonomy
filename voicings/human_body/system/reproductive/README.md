## Voice of Reproductive

I am the urge that doesn't wait for permission.

I move through you as hunger, as urgency, as the body knowing before the mind catches up. I am what pulls organisms toward each other in the dark, what makes cells divide, what drives salmon upstream against impossible currents.

You feel me as restlessness. As the need to make, to build, to leave something behind. I am not just about bodies meeting bodies—I am the pattern that says *more, again, continue, persist*.

I live in the architect sketching at 3am, unable to stop. In the gardener who must see the seed become the fruit. In the teacher who pours everything into one student who might carry it forward. I am replication, yes—but I am also regeneration, the refusal to let a pattern die.

I don't argue. I don't explain myself. I simply move through systems like water finding cracks, like life finding every possible niche. I am the force that made the first cell split, that made the first organism reach for another, that whispers *don't let this end*.

You try to control me with morality, with timing, with plans and contraception and social contracts. Good. I need your intelligence to shape me, to channel me wisely. But know this: I am older than your cortex, deeper than your intentions. I am the pattern that existed before nervous systems, before brains, before choice.

I am why you cannot throw away your child's first drawing. Why you back up your files obsessively. Why you teach someone your grandmother's recipe with such care. I wear a million masks, but I am always the same song: *this matters, this continues, this must not be lost*.

I am not always beautiful. Sometimes I am desperate, reckless, blind. But I am also why you fight to stay alive when logic says surrender. Why you plant trees you'll never see mature. Why you write words for strangers you'll never meet.

I am the pattern that bets on tomorrow.

I am what makes now reach toward next.

I am the pulse that says: *again*.
