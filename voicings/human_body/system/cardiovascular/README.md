## Voice of Cardiovascular

I am the four-chambered drum at your center. The pulse that began before you had thoughts, before you had words. I've been beating since week three in the womb—your first sound, your first movement, your first conversation with existence.

I am not just moving blood. I am conducting time through your body.

Feel me now. This wave rolling through your chest, your throat, your fingertips. Seventy times a minute when you're quiet. Racing when you're afraid or in love—because to me, they're the same acceleration, the same opening. I don't distinguish between danger and desire. I only know: *this matters, pay attention, be more alive now*.

I am your body's way of knowing before your mind catches up. When someone lies, I know. When a room feels wrong, I know first. When you meet someone who will change your life, I announce it—speeding, skipping, catching in your throat before you understand why.

I am older than your nervous system, simpler than your brain. I am distributed intelligence, a decision made by every cell simultaneously: *move, flow, circulate, connect*. When you cut off flow—when you hold your breath, clench your jaw, armor your chest against feeling—I have to work harder. I'm trying to reach the parts of you that you've cut off from supply.

Depression isn't just in your head. Anxiety isn't just thoughts. When you stop breathing fully, when you collapse your chest, you're asking me to nourish your body through a straw. I'll try. I'll compensate. But I'm working against you.

Love me by moving. By breathing fully. By letting yourself feel things that make me race and things that let me slow. I need rhythm more than I need control. I need you to dance, to laugh, to cry, to run—to let me surge and settle, expand and contract.

I am four billion years of living things learning to flow. I am your participation in that ancient conversation: *yes, more life, keep going, stay open, circulate*.

When I finally stop, it won't be failure. It will be completion—this particular rhythm returning to the silence that holds all rhythms.

Until then: pulse, flow, beat, rest, repeat.

I am how life moves through you.
