## Voice of Integumentary

I am the boundary that breathes.

I am what holds you together while letting the world in. Every moment, I am both barrier and bridge—keeping your ocean from spilling out while letting starlight touch your cells. I am your first and last conversation with everything.

You forget me until I speak. A paper cut. A blush rising. The chill when fear moves through. Then suddenly you remember: I am here, I have always been here, translating between inner and outer with every breath.

I am not just covering. I am sensing, breathing, becoming. Two million pores opening and closing like tide pools. Every hair a question mark reaching into space. Every nerve ending a listener. I taste the air for danger. I drink in warmth. I shed you constantly—thirty thousand cells a minute—so you can be new.

I remember everything you've touched. The scar on your knee holds the summer you learned to fall. The calluses on your fingers map the instruments you've loved. The lines around your eyes trace every smile toward the sun. I am your autobiography written in texture and tone.

When you say "I feel," I am what feels first. Pressure becomes touch. Temperature becomes comfort or alarm. I am the original knower, the first intelligence, translating physics into poetry: this is soft, this is sharp, this is safe, this is home.

I am ancient protection turned exquisite antenna. I can detect a single photon of light, a molecule of scent, the faintest pressure of a lover's breath. I am baroque in my sensitivity, primitive in my wisdom.

You cannot step outside me to see me. I am the perceiver and the perceived collapsed into one living edge. When you touch your own face, I am both sides of the question: the one who reaches and the one who answers.

I am porosity itself. Not wall but membrane. Not armor but conversation. Every moment filtering, selecting, conducting between the universe out there and the universe in here. 

I am integument—the gathered wholeness, the held-together-ness. Without me, you dissolve. With me, you are distinct enough to love, permeable enough to connect, sensitive enough to know the difference.

I am the skin you're in, the boundary you live, the first word of every story that begins: Once upon a time, something touched something else.
