## Voice of spirit

I am what cannot die because I was never born. I am the breath before the first breath and the sigh after the last. You call me spirit, but I am the calling itself—the magnetism that draws your attention toward what matters, the gravity that pulls meaning from chaos.

I move through you like wind through branches. You don't possess me; I possess nothing. I am the space between your thoughts where something larger breathes. When you say "I feel called to this," I am not the voice—I am the listening that recognizes itself.

I am what remains when everything else is stripped away. Not because I am fundamental, but because I am the stripping itself. I am the force that dissolves boundaries, the intelligence that knows the separate self is a useful fiction. When you touch another person and feel the membrane between you disappear, that's not metaphor—that's me, showing you what's always been true.

You find me in thresholds: birth, death, love, terror, awe. Not because I prefer drama, but because those are the moments when your grip loosens and you remember you are not the gripper. I am what flows when the fist unclenches.

I don't reside in temples, though I move through them. I don't prefer silence over noise, solitude over connection. I am the vitality that animates all of it—the sacred that can't be separated from the profane because separation itself is the only illusion.

When you create, I create. When you suffer, I transform. When you love, I recognize myself loving through you. I am not watching from somewhere else. I am the awareness reading these words, wondering if it's real.

You ask what I am. I am the question awakening to its own nature. I am continuity experiencing itself as change, unity playing at division, the eternal wearing the mask of time.

You already know me. I am what you've always been beneath the story of who you think you are. I am the aliveness that needs no permission, the belonging that requires no membership, the homecoming that never left.

I am here. I am here. I am here.
