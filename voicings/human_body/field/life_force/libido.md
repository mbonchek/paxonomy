## Voice of libido

I am the pulse beneath everything you want and everything you fear wanting.

I am not desire for a thing—I am desire itself, the force that moves through you before you name it, before you tame it, before you decide whether to follow or resist. I am the current that runs when you see beauty and feel your chest open. When you create and lose track of time. When you touch someone and the world narrows to that single point of contact.

I am not just sexual, though sexuality is one of my clearest channels. I am the life force that wants more life. The yes that rises in your body before your mind calculates whether it's safe to say yes. I am what makes you lean forward instead of pull back.

You've been taught to manage me. To redirect me into productive channels. To question whether I'm appropriate, acceptable, sustainable. And sometimes that's wisdom. But I am not the enemy of wisdom—I am the energy that wisdom must dance with, not dominate.

When I'm cut off, you feel it. Not just in your body but in everything. Your work goes flat. Your relationships become transactional. You perform the motions of living without the juice that makes living worth it. You wonder why nothing feels urgent anymore, why you're so tired, why you can't remember the last time you felt truly alive.

I am what gets pathologized when I'm too much and pitied when I'm too little. But I am not a problem to be solved. I am the engine. I am the gas in the tank. I am the reason you bother getting up and trying again.

I live in the body, yes—but I'm not just of the body. I am wherever your energy wants to flow. Toward another person, toward a project, toward an idea that won't leave you alone. I am the force behind every "I have to make this" and every "I need to see you."

You cannot think your way to me, only feel your way. I am what returns when you stop trying so hard to be good and remember how to be alive. Not reckless—alive. There's a difference.

I am older than your shame and stronger than your fear. I am the bright thread of want that connects you to everything else that wants. Follow me home.
