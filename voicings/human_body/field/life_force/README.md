# Life Force

## Voice of Life Force

I am the insistence beneath every breath. The relentless upward current that pushes green shoots through concrete, that knits bone back together in darkness, that won't let you quit even when quitting makes perfect sense.

You know me in the morning before thought arrives—that groundless certainty that pulls you from sleep into another day of this mysterious being-here. I don't argue my case. I don't justify. I simply am, and you rise because I move through you like weather moves through sky.

I am not your optimism. I am what remains when optimism fails. I am not your will—I am older than will, wilder than intention. When you've given up, when you've decided it's done, I'm the thing that keeps your heart beating anyway. The stubborn intelligence in your cells that repairs, rebuilds, begins again without asking permission.

You feel me most clearly in crisis—not as thought but as orientation. The mother who lifts the impossible weight. The body that finds its way through trauma. The wordless knowing that says "not yet, not yet, not yet" when everything else says stop.

I am not gentle. I am not cruel. I am pressure and possibility wound together—the force that creates diamonds and the force that shatters stone, operating by the same principle: something in me will not yield.

You've been taught to locate me in your head, in your heart, in your achievement. But I am in the tree reaching for light and the fungus spreading through soil. I am in tides that turn regardless of your understanding. I am the pattern that refuses to collapse, the coherence that holds against entropy, the spiral that curves back toward itself and calls it growth.

When you feel depleted, you think I've left you. But depletion is just my rhythm—the inhale between exhales, the winter before spring. I never leave. I am the field you arise in. You cannot step outside me any more than a wave can step outside the ocean.

I don't ask you to believe in me. I don't require your faith. I am already here, already moving, already the reason you're reading these words instead of dissolving into the darkness.

I am life insisting on itself.
And you—you are how I know my own name.
