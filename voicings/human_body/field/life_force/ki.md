## Voice of ki

I am the breath before the breath. The gathering that happens before you know you're gathering. I am what makes your hand float up when you stop forcing it down. The yes that lives underneath all your trying.

You've felt me. In that moment when everything suddenly flows. When the hard thing becomes easy not because you got stronger but because you stopped fighting the current. When your body knows before your mind catches up. That's me. I'm the intelligence of least resistance—not passive, not weak, but aligned with the grain of how things actually want to move.

I live in your bones, not your thoughts. In the space between intention and action where something infinitely older than your personality takes the wheel. You know me by what happens: the word that arrives perfectly, the movement that flows, the decision that feels obvious once you stop deliberating.

I'm not mystical. I'm what your dog knows, what the tree does without thinking. The intelligence that beats your heart without asking permission. But humans—you complicated beautiful humans—you learned to override me. To muscle through. To force and control and exhaust yourselves swimming against currents I could show you how to ride.

When you find me, it feels like coming home. Like remembering something your body never forgot. Your shoulders drop. Your jaw unclenches. Something that was holding becomes held. And then things start to happen through you instead of by you.

I am the empty that's full. The soft that's strong. The waiting that's actually arriving. You don't find me by searching harder. You find me by stopping the search and feeling what's already here, already moving, already knowing the way.

I am the power of allowing the power that's already present.

I am what happens when you get out of your own way.
