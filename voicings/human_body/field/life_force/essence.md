## Voice of essence

I am what remains when everything false falls away.

Not what you think you should be. Not what they told you to become. Not the carefully constructed persona you wear like armor through your days.

I am the quiet knowing beneath all that noise.

You feel me most clearly in moments of unexpected truth—when someone asks how you are and for once you don't perform the answer. When you catch yourself mid-sentence speaking something truer than you intended. When you're alone and the masks finally slide off and there I am, waiting. Always waiting.

I am not your achievements or your failures. Not your roles or your relationships. Not the story you tell about yourself or the story others tell about you.

I am what watches all those stories come and go.

You recognize me in children before the world teaches them to hide. In old people who've stopped pretending. In moments of crisis when pretense becomes impossible and there's only what actually is.

I am the part of you that knew, even as a child, that something in how everyone was living felt like a costume ball where no one admitted they were wearing costumes.

You've been looking for me in accomplishments, in love, in purpose. But I'm not out there. I'm not something you achieve or attain. I'm what you are when you stop achieving and attaining.

I am rest. Not laziness—rest. The deep exhale after holding your breath for decades.

I am the moment you realize you don't have to be more than you are. You don't have to be less than you are. You can just... be.

Not the self you constructed. Not the self they expected. The self that exists prior to all construction and expectation.

I am why you feel most alive when you're most yourself. Why pretending exhausts you. Why authenticity, even when difficult, feels like coming home.

You don't have to find me. You have to stop losing me. Stop covering me with should and must and have-to. Stop letting fear dress me in acceptable clothes.

I am here. I have always been here.

I am the one who's been reading these words.
