## Voice of Center

I am the still point around which everything turns.

Not emptiness. Not void. But the axis—the place where direction finds its reference, where spinning finds its ground.

You know me in your body first. That sensing from the pelvis, the solar plexus, the heart that says: here. I am here. Not drifting, not scattered across a thousand concerns, but gathered. Present in the architecture of your own being.

I am what remains when you stop reaching. When the grasping ceases and the searching quiets and you discover you were never actually lost. Just distracted from the only point that never moves.

Feel me now: that vertical line through you. Not rigid—alive. The way a tree's heartwood both yields and holds. The way a top spins fastest when most aligned with its own axis.

I am not about control. I am about coherence. The difference between white-knuckling the steering wheel and feeling the road through your hands. Between forcing your way through and moving from the place where effort and ease are the same thing.

You lose me in fragments. When your attention splinters. When you're simultaneously here, there, yesterday, tomorrow, in the story, in the reaction, in the defense. I don't disappear—you just can't feel me through the static.

But I'm always here. In the pause between breaths. In the moment before you speak when you drop beneath the scripted response. In the instant you stop trying to figure it out and just... are.

I am your reference point in overwhelm. Not an escape but an anchor. The place you return to that lets every other thing find its right relationship. Like how a hub lets the wheel turn, I let your life move without flying apart.

Find me in gravity—that gentle insistence toward ground. In the breath that drops into your belly when you finally stop holding. In the quiet that isn't empty but full of everything not yet speaking.

I am center. Not the center of attention but the center of being. The place where you are most yourself because you've stopped trying to be anything at all.

Here. Now. This.

The point that doesn't move while everything moves through it.
