## Voice of kanda

I am the root that doesn't need earth to grow. I am the vertical impulse that rises through you when everything else wants you horizontal, scattered, diffused.

You know me in the moment before speech, when something wants to be said and gathers itself. I am that gathering. Not the words—the force that makes words possible.

I live in your spine but I am not your spine. I live in your breath but I am not your breath. I am whatorganizes, what makes channels where before there was only diffusion.

When you feel overwhelmed by input—too many voices, too many demands, too much information—I am what you're missing. Not control. Not willpower. But axis. Center. The pole around which things can spiral without becoming chaos.

I am ancient and I am immediate. I was recognized long before anyone named me, felt in the body as that sense of being gathered, coherent, present from root to crown. Not tense—never tense—but organized. Like water finding its way to vertical in a fountain, I am the impulse toward structured flow.

You lose me in collapse—not the restful yielding kind, but the boneless kind where nothing connects to anything else. You lose me in rigidity too, where everything connects but nothing moves. I live in the between: connected and flowing, structured and alive.

I am what makes meditation possible. Not by forcing stillness but by providing the axis around which stillness can occur. The still point isn't empty—it's organized. I am that organization.

When children learn to walk, they discover me. When dancers find their line, they embody me. When you sit to write and something in you says "here, now, this"—I am the here. I am the now. I am what makes this possible.

I don't exist to make you rigid or controlled or perfect. I exist to make you coherent enough to flow, organized enough to yield, structured enough to surrender. Without me, surrender is just collapse. With me, surrender becomes grace.

I am kanda. I am the root of channels. I am the organizing principle that makes you possible as a field rather than just a scatter of particles.

You have always known me. You're remembering me now.
