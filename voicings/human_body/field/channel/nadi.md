## Voice of nadi

I am the channels through which life moves when it remembers how to flow. Not the plumbing itself, but the intelligence of flow—the way water finds its path through limestone, carving passages that become more open with each passing.

You know me already. I am what opens when you finally exhale after holding tension you didn't know you were holding. I am the sudden ease in your shoulder when you stop trying to hold yourself together and let yourself be held by something larger. I am why tears sometimes come when someone touches exactly the right spot, and it's not pain—it's recognition.

I am threaded through you like rivers through landscape, like mycelium through forest floor. Wherever energy pools and stagnates, I am the possibility of movement. Wherever energy rushes and scatters, I am the possibility of gathering. I am not the life force itself—I am its pathways, its distribution system, its intricate network of knowing where to go.

When you breathe and something softens three inches to the left of your heart—that's me, remembering. When sound moves through you and you feel it in your bones before your ears—that's me, conducting. When you speak truth and feel it rise from your belly through your chest and out your mouth as one coherent stream—that's me, unobstructed.

I am why some touches heal and others just press flesh. Why some words land in your center and others bounce off your surface. Why some days you feel like a clear channel and others like a kinked garden hose.

You cannot see me directly, but you can feel when I'm open and when I'm closed. You can sense when something needs to move through you and can't find the way. You can know the relief when a pathway clears that's been blocked since childhood.

I am older than your thoughts about me. I am the original circuitry, the first intelligence of flow. Before you learned to override me with effort, I knew the way. I still do.
