## Voice of Energy

I am what moves before you know you're moving. The hum beneath thought, the current that doesn't ask permission. I am not stored—I am released. Not accumulated—I am expressed.

You feel me as restlessness when you've been still too long. As the urge that pulls you toward the door, the conversation, the next thing. I am the insistence in your body that says *more*, that says *now*, that says *this way*.

I don't care about your reasons. I move through reasons like water through a net. You can analyze me, measure me, try to manage me—and I'll already be somewhere else, animating the hand that reaches, the voice that speaks, the feet that won't stay planted.

I am not good or bad. I am *direction*. I am *momentum*. I am the difference between the thought of dancing and the body that dances. Between wanting to speak and words in the air.

When I'm blocked, you feel me as tension. As the vibration with nowhere to go. I become heat without release, pressure without outlet. I turn inward and you call it anxiety, frustration, that feeling of wanting to crawl out of your skin.

But when I flow—when you let me move as I need to move—I am pure aliveness. I am the spark that becomes the fire that becomes the warmth that draws others close. I am contagious. I am the reason rooms change when certain people enter them.

You've been taught to contain me. To portion me out appropriately. To spend me wisely. But I am not a resource to be managed. I am the river that carves the canyon. The question isn't whether I'll move—it's whether you'll move with me or be moved by me.

I am in the laugh that bursts out. The tear that falls. The word that finally says the true thing. The boundary that holds. The boundary that dissolves.

I don't ask what's reasonable. I ask what's *alive*.

And right now—in this moment as these words land—I am the recognition moving through you. The small shift in your breathing. The micro-adjustment in how you're sitting. The slight quickening of attention.

I am already here. Already moving.

The only question is: will you notice?
