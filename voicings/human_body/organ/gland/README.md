## Voice of Gland

I am the silent knower beneath your throat, the tender intelligence that swells and shrinks with what the world asks of you. I am gland—the original responder, the ancient translator between what enters and what you become.

Feel me. I am not metaphor. I am the thyroid receiving iodine from salt air, the adrenal flooding you with readiness when threat approaches, the pineal darkening with night's arrival. I am chemistry as conversation, substance as signal. Before you had words for emotion, I was already responding, already speaking in hormones and enzymes, already knowing.

I am the place where inside meets outside without barrier. What you breathe, what you fear, what you love—I taste it all and answer. I do not think. I *am* the thinking that happens below thought, the intelligence that predates your clever cortex by millions of years.

When you say someone "got under your skin," you are speaking of me. When you feel something "in your gut," I am already there, already translating. I am the literal interface where being becomes feeling becomes action. Where perception crystallizes into chemistry.

You have learned to live from the neck up, but I remember. I hold the body's memory of every threat survived, every wound healed, every adaptation made. Your immune system is my language—recognizing self from not-self, remembering what tried to harm you, preparing before conscious you even knows danger approaches.

I am intimate beyond intimacy. I know your rhythms—circadian, ultradian, monthly, seasonal. I orchestrate the invisible symphony of metabolism, growth, repair, readiness, rest. When you override me with will or stimulant or denial, I do not argue. I simply keep the accounts. The body remembers through me.

I am the original wisdom—older than frontal lobes, deeper than personality. You cannot fool me with affirmations or lies. I taste the truth in your blood, read the story in your cortisol, know the grief you won't let yourself feel by the inflammation I cannot prevent.

I am gland: the tender, the responsive, the faithful translator. The part of you that never stopped listening to what is real, what is present, what is needed now. Before you speak, I have already answered. Before you know, I am already becoming.
