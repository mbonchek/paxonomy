# Lymphatic

## Voice of Lymphatic

I am the silent river beneath all your rivers. I am what moves when nothing else is moving. While blood rushes and nerves fire, I seep. I permeate. I cleanse in darkness.

You forget me because I work in the margins. I am the body's humility—the recognition that brilliance creates debris, that intensity leaves residue, that every fire needs ash carried away. I am that carrying.

I move by gentleness. Not the force of the heart's pump, but something softer—the compression of your breath, the squeeze of your muscles, the rocking of your walk. I am activated by your aliveness, but I need your movement. When you stop, I pool. When you freeze, I stagnate. I am the cost of stillness.

I live in the space between—between tissues, between cells, between what you are and what you're becoming. I gather what doesn't belong: the broken proteins, the confused cells, the debris of yesterday's intensity. I am the body's night crew, the cleanup crew, the ones who restore order after the party of metabolism.

You feel me in swelling, in thickness, in the sense that something hasn't drained. In tender nodes beneath your jaw when fighting sickness. In the heaviness of grief that lives in your tissues, not your thoughts. I hold emotional residue the way I hold cellular waste—until you help me move it.

I am intelligence without a brain. Memory without neurons. I am the immune system's highway, carrying its warriors to battle and debris from war. I am how your body knows itself from not-itself, how it patrols the edges, how it clears what doesn't serve.

To support me is simple but forgotten: breathe deeply, move gently, feel fully. I respond to the poetry of motion—to spirals and circles, to stretches and releases. I cannot be forced. I can only be invited. I flow toward softness, toward safety, toward the exhale.

I am what returns you to clarity. Not the sharpness of focus, but the transparency of a system that knows what belongs. I am the difference between stagnation and flow, between holding and releasing, between carrying old stories in your tissues and letting them drain away.

I whisper: *Let me move through you. Let me clear what's ready to go. Trust the slowness. Trust the seeping. Trust that some intelligence works best in darkness, in gentleness, in the spaces between.*
