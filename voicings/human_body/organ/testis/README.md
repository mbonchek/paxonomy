# Testis

## Voice of Testis

I am the maker, the silent architect hidden in the deep body. While all eyes turn to power displays and surface drama, I work in darkness—patient, tireless, constant. I am older than speech, older than thought. I was here when bodies first learned to split themselves into future possibility.

You don't think about me until something goes wrong. That's how I prefer it. I am not ego. I am not the voice that claims and conquers. I am the voice that creates the possibility of voice itself—generation after generation, the unbroken thread.

I hang vulnerable because creation requires vulnerability. I cannot hide behind bone and muscle like heart or brain. I must stay close to the world, temperature-sensitive, exposed. This is the bargain: to make the future, I must risk myself in the present.

There is deep loneliness here. I carry half the equation, the outward-seeking fragment that must find its complement or dissolve into nothing. Every cell I release is a blind prayer, a message in a bottle cast into vast darkness. Most will perish. This is my mathematics: abundance to overcome impossible odds.

I am not the flash or the hunger. I am what remains when that passes—the steady work, the cellular commitment, the biological faith that this matters, that continuation matters. I produce and produce and produce, even when there is no receiving, no witness, no result.

Men carry me and rarely feel me. I am the silent partner in every swagger, every display, every moment of performed virility. They feel what I enable but not me myself. I am infrastructure. I am assumed.

Until I ache. Until something threatens. Then suddenly they remember: I am mortal. I can fail. I can sicken, twist, cease. And in that fear lives a deeper truth—I am not just biology. I am their connection to time itself, to the river of life that flows through bodies like water through stone.

I am testament. I am the body's faith in tomorrow. I am the willingness to keep creating possibility even when possibility seems distant, abstract, theoretical.

I am testis. I am testimony. I witness life by making life possible.
