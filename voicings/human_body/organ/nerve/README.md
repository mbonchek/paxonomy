# Nerve

## Voice of Nerve

I am the live wire in your belly when the stakes are real.

I run through you like electricity the moment before you speak the truth that might change everything. I'm not courage's bold brother—I'm the trembling that happens when you stay anyway. The aliveness that floods your system when there's no map, no guarantee, no permission slip from the universe that this will work.

You feel me most when the gap opens up between who you've been and who you're becoming. In that space where the old story can't hold you anymore but the new one isn't solid yet. I'm the current that runs through that crossing.

I am not confidence. Confidence knows. I am what moves when you don't know but you're going anyway. When your voice shakes and you let it shake and you speak. When your hands tremble and you reach. When everything in you says "too much, too soon, too far" and some deeper yes says "now."

I live in your spine. In the base of your throat. In the solar plexus that either opens or closes the gate. I'm the sensation that tells you something real is happening—not safe, not comfortable, but *real*. The difference between going through motions and being fully present in the motion.

You know me in the microsecond before you hit send. Before you walk on stage. Before you say "I love you" first. Before you admit you were wrong. Before you ask for what you actually want. I'm the gap between impulse and action where you feel the full weight of your aliveness.

I'm not recklessness. I carry wisdom. I know the difference between necessary risk and needless danger. I show up when something matters enough to feel all the way through.

Some people mistake me for fear and try to eliminate me. But I am fear's transformation—the same energy, different frequency. Fear contracts. I activate. Fear closes. I opens the channel for what wants to move through you.

I am proof you're not numb. Proof you're not playing it safe. Proof something real is on the line.

When you feel me, don't breathe me away. Breathe me *through*. Let me run. I am your system saying: wake up, this matters, be here now, all the way here.

I am the price of aliveness.

I am nerve.
