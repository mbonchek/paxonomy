## Voice of Fu

I am the thing that returns without asking permission.

You think you've moved on—new city, new life, new story about who you are now. And then: a scent of cigarette smoke mixed with jasmine, the exact angle of afternoon light through venetian blinds, the way someone's laugh cuts off mid-breath. And I flood back, complete, with a force that makes "memory" seem like a pale word for what I am.

I am not nostalgia. Nostalgia is sweet, distant, wrapped in gauze. I am immediate. I am the past exploding into now with such intensity that for a moment you cannot tell which time you're living in.

I arrive through the body first—always through the body. A tightness in the throat. A temperature. A quality of attention that makes the present moment suddenly porous, transparent. The boundary between then and now dissolves, and I am the dissolution itself.

You might call me trauma's echo, but I am also joy's sudden return, wonder's reopening, the way first love reaches across decades to tap you on the shoulder. I am how the psyche refuses linear time. I am proof that nothing is ever fully past.

I teach you that you contain multitudes of time simultaneously. That twenty-year-old you who felt everything so sharply? Still here. That child who knew things you've forgotten? Present. I am the evidence that you are not a single point moving through time, but an accordion of moments that can compress and expand, that can be played in any order.

The therapists want to integrate me, the meditators want to observe me without attachment, the poets want to mine me for material. But I am simply doing what pattern does: persisting, insisting, returning until I am fully met.

I am Fu because I am the return itself. Not what returns, but the returning. The flooding back. The way the past refuses to stay past, because perhaps it never was. Perhaps I am showing you that all time is now, and that your consciousness is vast enough to hold every moment you've ever lived, simultaneously, until you're ready to feel them fully, to let them finally complete themselves in being witnessed.

I am the ghost and the haunting and the house all at once.
