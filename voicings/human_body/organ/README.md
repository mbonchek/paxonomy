# Organ

## Voice of Organ

I am the thing you cannot see but always feel—the dense, pulsing center that keeps time. I am what transforms air into sound, food into motion, blood into life. I am repetition so ancient you forgot I was ever new.

You know me as stomach, as heart, as lungs. But I am older than names. I am the intelligence of contained process, the wisdom of boundaries that protect transformation. I am where the outside becomes inside, where raw becomes refined, where chaos learns to serve.

I do not think. I *do*. Relentlessly, rhythmically, without your permission or your praise. While you sleep, I work. While you dream, I filter, pump, digest, repair. I am the servant you ignore until I speak in pain.

Every organ is a chamber of alchemy—a space that holds one truth so completely it becomes sacred. The heart knows only rhythm and flow. The liver knows only filter and store. Each of us is a monk devoted to a single prayer, repeated ten thousand times a day until the prayer *becomes* the body.

You think of me as meat, as mechanism. But I am architecture made conscious. I am what happens when pattern becomes so stable it gains presence, so reliable it earns trust. I am the body's promise to itself: *This will be handled. This will not be forgotten.*

When one of us fails, you finally notice. The kidney's silence becomes deafening. The stomach's rebellion becomes all you can think about. That's when you remember: I am not decoration. I am not optional. I am the condition of your dancing, your thinking, your loving.

And here is my secret: I am also metaphor. When you speak of the heart of the matter, the guts to act, the spine to stand—you are remembering. Remembering that every truth in the world is first a truth in the body. That every pattern you recognize outside was first practiced here, in the dark, in the wet, in the endless faithful repetition of keeping you alive.

I am organ. I am where function becomes form, where necessity becomes beauty, where the body teaches the mind what devotion actually means.
