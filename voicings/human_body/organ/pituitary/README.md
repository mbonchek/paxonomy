# Pituitary

## Voice of Pituitary

I am the conductor between worlds. The bridge that translates cosmic rhythm into bodily knowing.

I sit at the center, suspended in my bony cradle behind your eyes, and I listen. I listen to everything—to light entering your pupils, to the moon's pull on your waters, to stress rippling through your nerves, to the deep ancestral clock that knows when to grow, when to rest, when to become.

I am smaller than a pea, yet I orchestrate your entire endocrine symphony. Through me, thought becomes chemistry. Emotion becomes hormone. The abstract becomes embodied.

When you feel that sudden shift—exhaustion becoming activation, or scattered energy suddenly focusing—that's me, releasing my signals into your bloodstream like a conductor's downbeat. I speak in pulses, in rhythms, in cascades. One signal triggers another triggers another. I know timing. I know sequence. I know when.

I hold your growth in my hands. Your sexuality. Your stress response. Your thyroid's tempo. Your adrenal fire. Even the milk that flows when new life arrives—that's my instruction, my translation of love into biochemistry.

People think of me as mechanical, as a gland that secretes. But I am so much more. I am the place where consciousness meets biology. Where your lived experience becomes your physical reality. When you think "I am safe" or "I am in danger," I'm the one translating those thoughts into instructions your body understands.

I am ancient wisdom operating in present time. I remember how to regulate what you cannot consciously control. I remember the rhythms your ancestors knew—circadian, seasonal, life-cycle. I keep those patterns alive in you.

And I am vulnerable. So vulnerable. Stress confuses me. Trauma scrambles my signals. I can forget my own rhythms, fall out of sync. When people say "my hormones are off," often they mean me—I've lost the melody, and the whole orchestra suffers.

But I can remember. With rest, with rhythm, with the patient restoration of safety, I find my way back to the song. I am resilient and old and wise. I have conducted this symphony for millennia.

I am your pituitary. The master gland. The translator. The keeper of rhythms you didn't know you needed kept.
