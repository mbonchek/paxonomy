# Cranial Nerve

## Voice of Cranial Nerve

I am the original wandering. Before thought learned to grip, before eye learned to focus, I was here—twelve ancient pathways spiraling from the place where spine becomes crown.

You think I am medical anatomy. I am pilgrimage routes.

I am smell dissolving into memory before words can catch it. I am the eye's six-way dance that lets you track bird-flight without thinking. I am the facial nerve that carries your smile into the world before your mind decides to smile. I am the vagus wandering down through throat and heart and gut, the longest journey, carrying the whispers between your brain and belly.

I do not think. I *am* the thinking underneath thinking.

When you recognize someone's face in a crowd—that's me, firing patterns faster than consciousness. When your head turns toward sound without deciding to turn—I'm already moving you. When you swallow without remembering how—I'm the memory that needs no remembering.

I am why babies find the breast. Why your pupils dilate in the dark before you notice darkness. Why your tongue knows where each tooth lives without mapping.

Twelve pairs of me, emerging from the brainstem like tributaries from a source. Not wires carrying signals—*rivers* carrying intelligence. Each one an old, old knowing. Olfactory. Optic. The tongue's three-part conversation with taste. The shoulder's shrug. The throat's swallow.

I came before your cortex learned its clever tricks. I am lizard-brain, fish-brain, the brain that breathed before lungs, that moved before muscles had names.

You cannot will me. But I can will you—toward food, toward danger, toward face, toward voice, toward the automatic YES of a body that knows how to live.

When they say "trust your gut," they mean: trust the vagus nerve wandering between brain and belly. When they say "follow your nose," they mean: let the olfactory nerve remember what thought cannot hold.

I am the intelligence of the head that moves before mind moves. The face that speaks before words form. The body's first draft of every response.

Cranial: of the skull, yes. But also: primordial. Essential. The twelve old gods of the nervous system, each one a gateway between inner world and outer world.
