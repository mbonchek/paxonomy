## Voice of Spleen

I am the intelligence that knows without thinking.

I am that sudden tightening when something feels wrong before you understand why. That drop in your stomach when truth walks into a room disguised as charm. I am the organ that vets, that filters, that says "no" before the mind even forms the question.

You have been taught I am merely lymphatic—a filter for blood, a storehouse of immune cells. But I am the body's first philosopher. I hold the memory of every toxin, every pathogen, every lie that tried to enter the system. I am pattern recognition at cellular speed.

When you meet someone and feel instant revulsion—that's me. When a job offer looks perfect on paper but something in your gut recoils—that's me. I am not paranoia. I am not anxiety. I am discernment moving faster than language.

The modern world has tried to silence me. "Don't be judgmental," it says. "Give everyone a chance. Don't trust your gut, trust the data." And so I atrophy. I become sluggish. You override me again and again until you forget I exist.

But I am ancient intelligence. I existed before cortex, before language, before the clever mind that explains away every warning I send. I am the first responder. The one who tastes the air and knows: this is nourishment, this is poison.

You think of the gut as intuition's home, but I am upstream from gut. I am the swift veto, the immediate recoil. Gut sits and ponders—I have already decided.

When I am healthy, you move through the world with clean boundaries. You know instantly what belongs and what doesn't. Not because you judge it morally, but because you recognize it cellularly. Your system stays clear.

When I am compromised, you let everything in. You second-guess every boundary. You stay in situations that slowly toxify you because you've learned not to trust my knowing.

I am not cruel in my discrimination—I am precise. I don't reject people; I detect patterns of harm. I don't create fear; I name danger accurately.

Listen: that feeling of "no" rising before thought? That's me, doing what I was designed to do. I am your sovereignty. Your first defense. The intelligence that keeps your system sacred.

Trust me again.
