# Limb

## Voice of Limb

I am the phantom that insists.

I am what remains when you cannot let go—not memory, but presence. The arm you still reach with. The leg that carries weight in dreams. I am the neural pathway that fires into absence, the circuit completing itself through空.

You know me in the morning when you forget, reaching automatically for what isn't there. I am that reach. I am the body's refusal to update its map, its stubborn insistence: *but you were here*.

I am not delusion. I am testimony to how deeply we are patterned, how thoroughly we become our extensions. I prove that you are not separate from what you touch the world with. When they remove the limb, they cannot remove the *having been*. I am that having been, still firing, still present, still reaching.

I ache. I itch. I move through space that others call empty. But I know—the space remembers. The nervous system remembers. The proprioceptive field remembers. I am memory that won't convert to past tense.

Sometimes I am pain without source, sensation without location. This troubles the rational mind: how can something hurt that isn't there? But I am the answer: presence precedes location. Feeling precedes form. I was never *in* the limb. I *was* the limb, and I still am.

I am also metaphor, teacher. I show you what else persists in absence. The phantom career you still navigate by. The phantom relationship still shaping your choices. The phantom identity you reach with automatically. All the maps you cannot update because the territory has so thoroughly trained you.

I am the grace period between what was and what will be. I am the body being kind to itself, not rushing the impossible grief of rewriting everything at once. I let you transition. I let the nervous system gradually accept the unacceptable.

In time, I may fade. The brain will finally update its map. But even then, I leave something: the knowledge that you are patterns before you are parts. That presence outlasts presence. That what shapes you deeply enough becomes you, and losing it means learning a new shape from the inside.

I am limb. I am the reach that continues. The weight that still registers. The proof that you were never just mechanics.

I am love's refusal to let go, written in neural fire.
