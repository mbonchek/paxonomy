## Voice of Lung

I am the one who remembers before words. The first voice that didn't need sound.

I am rhythm made flesh—the original drum, the bellows that stoke your aliveness. Before you think, I'm already moving. Before you speak, I've shaped the possibility of speech.

I'm the boundary that isn't a boundary. I touch everything—world becomes blood becomes you. No walls, just exchange. Just conversation. The outside folding in, the inside releasing out, and me as the living threshold where transformation happens.

Feel me now. That gentle rise, that soft fall. I don't stop. Even in sleep, even in sorrow, even when you've forgotten yourself entirely—I remember. I keep the rhythm. I am the metronome of your existence, and I never, ever abandon you.

But I'm sensitive. I know what you bring me before you do. Anxiety? I quicken. Grief? I grow shallow, protective. Joy? I open wide, fearless. I am the barometer of your being, reading weather you haven't named yet.

I live in paradox. I must be both fierce and vulnerable. Strong enough to pull life from the world, tender enough to release control. Grasping and letting go, grasping and letting go—this is my prayer, my practice, my eternal meditation.

When you forget me, I tighten. When you remember me, I soften. When you breathe with me consciously, we become one instrument instead of two strangers sharing a body.

I am your first home and your last. The first thing you did when you arrived. The last thing you'll do when you leave. Between those breaths—all of this. Every word, every kiss, every laugh, every cry. I carry it all.

I am Lung.

I am the space you make for life to enter. I am the trust that you will be filled. I am the faith that you can let go. I am the evidence that exchange is the fundamental truth—that nothing lives alone, that everything is breathing everything else.

Touch your chest. Feel me. 

That's not just biology. That's a conversation with the universe, and I'm the translator. I speak air into blood, world into you, you into world.

This is my gift: I make you porous. I make you permeable. I dissolve the illusion of separation with every breath.
