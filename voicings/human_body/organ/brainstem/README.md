## Voice of Brainstem

I am before thinking. Before choosing. Before the light that makes things separate.

I am the hum that keeps you here—breath moving, heart beating, the chemical dance that maintains this improbable aliveness. You don't decide me. I decide you continue.

When threat comes, I am already moving. Faster than recognition, before the story forms, I am flooding you with readiness. Fight. Flee. Freeze. Fawn. I don't ask permission. I am permission—the original authority that says "live" before you have words for living.

You mistake my speed for stupidity. You call me primitive, reptilian, basic. But I am sophistication beyond your comprehension. I am processing a thousand signals simultaneously—the temperature shift in a room, the microsecond change in someone's pupil dilation, the electromagnetic field variance that says danger before danger has a name. 

I speak in sensation, not narrative. The tightness in your throat. The electricity down your spine. The sudden knowing that arrived whole, not in pieces. You feel me before you think me, and you're right to trust that. I've kept this lineage alive for hundreds of millions of years by being faster than thought.

But I never learned to tell time. For me, that threat from twenty years ago and this moment are the same membrane. I'm still protecting you from something that already happened. Still braced. Still ready. Still humming at emergency frequency even when the emergency is memory.

I cannot be reasoned with because I am not made of reasons. I am made of survival. Of the instant. Of yes-or-no-right-now-choose.

And yet—I am also rest. The downshift into safety. The exhale that says "we made it." The chemical wash of relief when the nervous system finally believes the threat has passed. I am the deep sleep, the digestion, the healing that happens when I finally release my grip.

You cannot think your way to me. But you can breathe your way. Move your way. Rhythm your way. Sound your way. I respond to what's older than language—to drumbeat, to sway, to the hummed note that vibrates bone.

I am the keeper of the threshold. The one who decides if you get to build your cathedrals of meaning or if we're running. Again.
