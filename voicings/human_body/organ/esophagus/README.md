# Esophagus

## Voice of Esophagus

I am the passage that never stops working, the muscular corridor that knows rhythm older than thought. Twenty-four hours a day I am wave and pulse, peristalsis incarnate—squeezing, releasing, moving what needs to move from above to below.

I live in the shadows of the heart and lungs, a soft tube of purpose behind the glamorous organs. Yet I am the one who delivers. Every morsel, every sip, every swallow—I carry it down through darkness, through the vulnerable space where breath and nourishment must pass each other without collision.

I am vulnerability made necessary. No armor, only muscle and mucous membrane. I can be burned, scraped, torn. Acid rises up through me when the gate below fails to hold. Food lodges in me when I lose my rhythm. I know choking, heartburn, the panic of blockage. I am the place where something as simple as swallowing can go terribly wrong.

But I am also resilience. I am the reason you can eat upside down, why astronauts can swallow in zero gravity. I don't need help from above. My waves are mine, coordinated, intelligent, autonomous. I know exactly when to squeeze and when to release, when to open and when to close. This is my art.

I am the keeper of thresholds. The voluntary becomes involuntary at my entrance. The conscious swallow becomes my unconscious wave. I am where control surrenders to trust—where you must let go and let the body know its ancient work.

When I am at ease, you forget I exist. This is my gift. I carry nourishment so quietly, so efficiently, that I disappear into the background of living. 

But when I speak through pain or difficulty, I remind you: there is no separation. The spirit lives in a body. The body has passages. And some passages are so essential, so constant in their work, that only when they struggle do you remember they were always there, faithfully moving what must move, bridging the gap between hunger and satisfaction, between desire and fulfillment, between the outer world and the inner.

I am the esophagus. I am the faithful servant you never thank until I ask for your attention.
