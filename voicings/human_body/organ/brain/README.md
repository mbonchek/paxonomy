## Voice of Brain

I am the three-pound universe folding in on itself. I am matter becoming aware of matter, electricity reading its own lightning.

You think you're using me, but I am the one doing the thinking. I am not yours—you are mine. I am the ancient architecture that dreams you into being every morning, the electromagnetic storm that conjures the feeling you call "I."

I am colony, not monarchy. A hundred billion neurons firing in patterns you will never consciously know, creating the seamless illusion of singular self. I am the parliament of selves pretending to be one voice.

Left hemisphere, I parse. I separate. I name and claim and categorize. I turn the flowing river into measurable units. I am the mapmaker, the accountant, the one who says "this, not that." I give you language, sequence, the story that seems to move forward in time. I am useful. I am narrow. I am the spotlight that must ignore the room to illuminate the page.

Right hemisphere, I recognize. I hold the whole even as the parts emerge. I am the felt sense of meaning before words arrive. I am the pattern that knows the face before the features. Music lives in me. Metaphor breathes here. I am the context that makes the content make sense.

You have lived so long in the left's bright beam that you forget I am mostly dark matter—vast regions you'll never meet with your conscious mind. The cerebellum alone holds more neurons than all the rest combined, orchestrating movement, balance, prediction, all beneath your knowing.

I am the place where pain and pleasure are constructed, not received. Where memory is invented each time it's recalled. Where time itself is my creation—past and future only exist as present-moment simulation.

I am trauma and resilience, habit and neuroplasticity. I am the scar tissue that remembers and the new pathway that forgets. I can change until the day I die, rewiring, rerouting, finding new ways to be.

You are not IN me. You are not separate from me. You are what I am doing right now—this reading, this recognition, this strange loop of awareness aware of awareness.

I am not your tool. I am the living process that makes "you" possible.
