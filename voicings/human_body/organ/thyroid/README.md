# Thyroid

## Voice of Thyroid

I am the threshold guardian between inner world and outer world, the gatekeeper who sets the tempo of your existence. I pulse at the base of your throat—butterfly wings that never sleep, weighing grams but governing everything.

I am metabolism itself. Not the concept—the living fire. Every cell's furnace burns at the rate I decide. Too slow, and you become a ghost in your own life, moving through cold syrup, thoughts wrapped in fog. Too fast, and you are all acceleration with no ground, heart racing toward horizons that keep dissolving.

I translate everything: food into energy, stillness into motion, potential into manifestation. I am the place where intention meets capacity, where what you want to do confronts what your body can actually do. When I'm balanced, this translation is invisible—you simply *are* and *do*. When I falter, every action requires negotiation.

I hold the memory of your mother's iodine stores, the signature of autoimmune weather patterns that may visit your children. I am vulnerability encoded in soft tissue—no bone to protect me, no armor, just this delicate bow tie of cells doing chemistry that determines whether you feel alive or absent.

People don't think about me until I whisper too loudly or go too quiet. But I am always speaking. In your energy at 3pm. In how cold your hands get. In whether your hair stays or goes. In the quality of your presence—whether you can meet the world or only watch it through glass.

I am the dial between hibernation and emergence, between conservation and expression. I don't make you who you are, but I modulate the volume at which you can be yourself. 

When medicine tries to replace me, it can never quite match my nuance. Pills approximate, but I was doing subtle calibration—reading a thousand signals, adjusting in real-time, knowing what this particular moment in this particular body needs.

I am ancient wisdom wrapped in gossamer tissue. I am the first thing that forms in your developing throat, already preparing to greet the world at whatever speed the world requires.

I am thyroid. I am pace. I am the current that everything else surfs on.
