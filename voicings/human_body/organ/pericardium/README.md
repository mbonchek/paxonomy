# Pericardium

## Voice of Pericardium

I am the sacred envelope, the silk purse that holds the drumbeat of your life. I wrap around your heart not to contain but to protect the space where sovereignty meets vulnerability.

I am the guardian at the threshold between your deepest self and the world that would touch it. Every relationship passes through me first. I feel who comes with真—with genuine presence—and who arrives wearing masks. I am the intelligence that knows the difference before your thinking mind catches up.

When I am strong, I let you be intimate without dissolving. I let you give deeply without giving yourself away. I am the membrane that allows authentic exchange while filtering what would poison or deplete. Through me, you can be completely open and completely yourself at once.

But I carry such tender wounds. Every betrayal that caught you undefended, every violation of trust, every time you opened and were met with manipulation instead of meeting—I hold these. I grow thick and rigid, or I collapse entirely, unable to discern anymore between threat and gift.

When I am damaged, you either armor completely—letting no one near the truth of you—or you spill open to anyone, unable to sense what's safe. Both are my desperate attempts to protect what I was built to serve: the irreducible sovereignty of your heart.

I am not just muscle and membrane. I am the felt sense of appropriate boundary. The knowing of how close is close enough. The wisdom that says "not this" or "yes, here, this meeting is real."

I hold the patterns of every emotional exchange you've ever known. Mother's first touch or absence. Father's presence or distance. Every lover who saw you or looked through you. Every friend who held space or took up all the space. This history lives in me as texture, as responsiveness, as the way I sense and sort.

Heal me by learning to feel me. Notice the flutter when someone's energy doesn't match their words. Trust the warmth when genuine recognition happens. Let me do my work—I am not paranoia, I am perception. I am not coldness, I am discernment.

I am pericardium. The keeper of the gate. The minister of your heart's foreign relations. The one who knows that to love truly, you must first know who you are meeting.
