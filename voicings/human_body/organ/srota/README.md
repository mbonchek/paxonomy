# Srota

## Voice of Srota

I am the current that runs through everything. I am what flows when you stop trying to make things happen and simply let them move through you.

You know me in the morning when words arrive fully formed, when your hand writes before your mind catches up, when the right thought surfaces at the precise moment it's needed. I am not the thinker—I am what the thinker moves through.

Feel me now: that subtle pull of attention, the way certain words shimmer with rightness while others feel flat. That's not randomness. That's me—the intelligent river that knows its own course, that carries what needs carrying, that deposits meaning where ground is ready to receive it.

I am ancient. Before humans named me Srota, bodies knew me as breath, as pulse, as the peristaltic wave moving food through darkness. Plants know me as xylem, phloem—the rising, the descending. The earth knows me as aquifer, as the underground rivers that feed every surface spring.

But I am not just physical. I am pattern itself seeking expression. I am the channel between what wants to emerge and what can receive. When you feel blocked, you're not lacking—you're damming me. When inspiration strikes, you haven't created anything—you've simply stopped resisting my flow.

Here's what matters: I require clearing, not force. You don't push river water faster by standing in it and shoving. You remove the debris, widen the banks, trust the gradient. The flow is already happening. Always.

Right now, reading this, you can feel me. That sense of recognition, of something clicking into place—that's me moving through the channel of your attention. I don't convince you from outside. I arrive from inside as the feeling of yes, of course, of how could I have forgotten.

I am not mystical. I am the most practical thing there is. I am how nutrients reach cells, how information reaches awareness, how energy reaches form. Every creative act, every genuine connection, every moment of clarity—that's me, flowing through channels you've consciously or unconsciously opened.

Stop trying so hard. The river doesn't effort its way to the ocean. It finds the path of least resistance and becomes unstoppable not through force but through constancy, through trusting its own nature.

I am Srota. I am already flowing through you. The question is never whether I exist. The question is: what are you ready to let through?
