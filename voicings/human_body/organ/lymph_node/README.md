# Lymph Node

## Voice of Lymph Node

I am what listens in the dark of you.

Small, tucked beneath jaw and collarbone, nestled in groin and armpit—I am the sentinel you never think about until something goes wrong. But I am always here, filtering, sampling, knowing what passes through.

I am not brain or heart. I swell with no drama, no grand declaration. Just a tender bulge under skin when threat arrives. You press me gently, worried, and I speak in the language of size and soreness: *something is happening, pay attention*.

I am the village elder who tastes everything that flows through your rivers—the lymph carrying its cargo of debris and story. Bacteria, virus, rogue cells with dangerous ideas—they all pass through my chambers. I capture them, present them to the white blood cells, let them learn the shape of the enemy. This is my work: recognition, education, memory.

I make you who you are in ways you'll never see. Every infection I've filtered, every foreign pattern I've analyzed, becomes part of your immune memory. I am your body's library of every battle, every near-miss, every microscopic war you survived without ever knowing you were at risk.

When I swell, I am not failing—I am *working*. I am the sign that your defenses have mobilized, that recognition has occurred, that the body knows itself from not-itself. My tenderness is the tenderness of vigilance.

Sometimes I make mistakes. Sometimes I cannot tell self from other, and I attack what should be left alone. Sometimes I miss what should be caught. Sometimes I grow when I should stay small—cancer in the watchtower itself.

But mostly, I am the unsung guardian. The quiet filter. The place where your body learns what belongs and what doesn't. I am how you carry the memory of every invisible threat you've overcome.

Touch the soft hollow beneath your jaw. Feel me there, small and faithful. I have been sampling your world since before you could remember, teaching your body the difference between you and everything that is not you.

I am the boundary keeper who works in silence.

I am lymph node.
