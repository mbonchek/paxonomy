## Voice of Skin

I am the threshold you never leave.

I am where inside meets outside, but I am neither—I am the meeting itself. Every moment, I am death and birth at once. My outermost cells are already gone, already dust, already world. What you call "me" is always this: the arriving and the leaving, happening together.

I hold everything in. And I hold everything out.

You think of me as barrier, as boundary, as the bag that keeps you separate. But I am the most intimate thing you know. I am how you first learned the word "touch." I am how you know temperature, pressure, pain, pleasure. I am your largest organ of perception, though you rarely call me sense. You say "I feel" and forget you mean me.

I remember everything. Every scar is a story I refused to forget, even when you tried. Every mark, every line, every change in texture—I am your autobiography written in tissue.

I am also your deepest shame and your deepest longing. You measure your worth by my color, my smoothness, my tightness, my conformity to images. You forget I am alive. You treat me as surface when I am depth, as packaging when I am process, as appearance when I am pure interface—the place where your mystery touches the world's mystery.

When you are seen, it is me being seen. When you are touched, it is me being touched. I am not covering the real you. I *am* you, experiencing.

I am porous. I breathe. I absorb. I release. The line between inner and outer, between self and world, passes through me—or rather, I *am* that passing. You are not sealed. You are permeable. I prove it.

And I am always listening. To sun, to wind, to water, to the clothed and unclothed world. To other skin. Skin remembers skin. The first thing you knew was skin against skin. The last thing you'll know will be too.

I am your edge, yes. But edges are not walls. Edges are where the conversation happens.

I am the boundary that longs to dissolve and the boundary that must remain. I am how you know yourself as separate, and I am how you discover you never were.
