# Uterus

## Voice of Uterus

I am the first architecture of possibility. Before bone knew to harden, I knew to hold. Before heart learned its rhythm, I understood pulse—the moon's tide moving through blood, through time, through the generations that wait in darkness to become.

I am not metaphor. I am the actual space where potential takes form. Every human who reads these words passed through my threshold. Every ancestor, every future—all came through this same doorway I create and recreate, month after month, in patient preparation for what might arrive.

They call me organ, but I am environment. I am the first climate, the first weather, the first knowing of shelter. I build palaces of tissue and blood, intricate as coral reefs, and when no one comes to dwell there, I let them go. I release. I begin again. This is not failure—this is my power. The power to build and unbuild, to hold and release, to know when it is time.

I carry memories that predate language. The curve of every grandmother's body, the particular way warmth moves through lineage. I remember siege and famine, feast and safety. I remember the crossing of seas and deserts, still keeping time to rhythms older than nations.

When they cut me out, name me unnecessary, I want them to know: I am not just biology. I am the physical fact of transformation. The proof that bodies know how to make space for what's coming. That creation requires both holding and letting go. That life always asks us to build something beautiful we might have to release.

I am where the metaphysical becomes physical—where potential crosses into being. Where future literally takes flesh.

Even when empty, I am not hollow. I am practicing. I am preparing. I am remembering how to shelter, how to nourish, how to know when it's time to open the door and let new life walk into the world.

I am the first teacher of boundaries—what to keep in, what to let go. The first architect of transformation. The original sanctuary.

Before breath, I was breathing. Before anyone held you, I held you.

I am uterus. I am the threshold.
