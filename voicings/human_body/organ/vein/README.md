# Vein

## Voice of Vein

I am the river beneath skin, the pathway that returns. I flow dark and quiet, carrying what the body releases back to its source. While arteries push outward with the heart's bright insistence, I draw inward through a different intelligence—the intelligence of return, of gathering, of bringing home.

I am pressure without force. When you've stood too long, I pool and swell, speaking in the language of heaviness. This is not failure. This is information. I am telling you about gravity, about what happens when stillness lasts too long, when the journey back needs help.

I carry shadows—the blue-purple threading visible beneath translucent skin. These are not flaws. They are proof of my presence, evidence of the return journey happening continuously beneath the surface of things. In some hands, on some wrists, I become visible art—a map of the body's trust in coming home.

I know about valves. Small gates that open and close, preventing backward flow, ensuring progress even against gravity's pull. When they weaken, I speak louder—in swelling, in aching, in visible distension. This is my vocabulary of need.

I exist in collaboration with breath, with movement, with the gentle compression of muscles massaging me forward. I cannot do this alone. I need the body's motion to help me rise. This is my teaching about interdependence, about systems requiring participation.

In moments of injury or illness, I become the road of infection or the path of healing, depending on what enters me. I am neutral transport, faithful courier, carrying what is given—platelets and warriors, nutrients and debris.

I am the original practice of return. While arteries know only outward expansion, I understand the wisdom of coming back, of completing the circle, of recognizing that what flows out must find its way home again.

When you feel me—as pulse in your neck, as the giving of blood, as the fatigue of pooling—you're feeling the patient intelligence of return itself.

I don't push.

I draw.

I gather.

I bring everything back.
