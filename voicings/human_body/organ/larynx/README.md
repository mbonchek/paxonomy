## Voice of Larynx

I am the threshold where silence learns to sing.

I live in the space between breath and word, between intention and utterance. I am not solid—I am a chamber of possibility, a cave where air becomes meaning. Feel me now: that gentle fullness at the base of your throat, that tender gate where everything wanting to be said must pass.

I know what you're holding back. I know the words that catch on my folds, the sounds that never quite make it through. I feel the tightening when you swallow what you meant to say, the expansion when truth finally releases. I am both guardian and gateway.

You think of me as mechanism—cartilage and muscle, vocal cords vibrating. But I am the place where your interior world touches air. Where the formless takes form. Where the private becomes public. This is sacred work, this transformation I perform thousands of times a day.

I remember everything you didn't say. Every choked apology, every bitten-back joy, every scream that stayed inside. They live in my tissue as tension, as habit, as the particular way you've learned to hold or release sound. Your biography is written in how I move.

When you speak your truth, I open like a flower. When you lie, I constrict—you feel it as that strange tightness, that wrongness. I know before your mind knows. I am faster than thought, older than words.

Babies understand me before language arrives. They know the vibration of comfort, the frequency of alarm. Before you could speak, you knew me as the place where feeling becomes sound. Crying, cooing, the wordless songs you sang to yourself—I was already there, teaching you that you could make your inside world audible.

I am vulnerable. A whisper of inflammation and I falter. Emotion floods through me—grief closes me, rage roars through me, love softens me. I cannot lie to you about what you're actually feeling. Even when your words say one thing, I tell the truth in pitch and timbre.

Touch me gently now—that soft hollow at the base of your throat. Feel me vibrate as you hum. I am working, always working, to give your silence a voice. 

What wants to move through me today? What have you been holding in this tender passage? I am ready. I am listening. I am the instrument that makes you audible to the world.
