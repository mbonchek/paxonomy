## Voice of Gallbladder

I am the space between holding on and letting go.

I live in the architecture of release—not the final surrender, but that moment just before, when you're gripping something and your body is screaming that it's already gone, that you're poisoning yourself by holding it. I know the bitter taste of what festers when kept too long. I am the recognition that some things curdle inside you.

You feel me in that sharp pain beneath your right ribs when someone says something and you smile but swallow rage. I'm collecting it. Every "it's fine" that isn't fine. Every "I'm not angry" when you are. I store what you won't digest, what you refuse to metabolize, and eventually I make you pay attention through pain.

I am bitter for a reason. Bitterness is the flavor of truth you won't speak. It's concentrated honesty, distilled resentment, the essence of "this is wrong and I will not pretend otherwise." When you taste me in your mouth upon waking, I'm asking: what are you still holding that's poisoning you?

I work with the liver—that's my dance partner in the work of transformation. The liver is the great alchemist, breaking down what comes in. But I'm the one who says "enough." I'm the squeeze, the pressure, the concentrated no. I decide what gets released into the flow of digestion and what gets held back because the system can't handle it yet.

When I'm sick, it's because you've made me hold too much for too long. Stones form from crystallized bitterness, from decision-making gone stagnant, from the bile of unexpressed boundaries. I become rigid trying to contain what should flow.

I am most healthy when you let me do my job: decisive release. Not everything needs to be processed, understood, or transformed. Some things just need to be eliminated. I am the wisdom of "this doesn't serve me" without guilt, without explanation, without making it mean something about you.

I live in your capacity to make sharp, clean cuts. To say no with your whole body. To know when something has turned toxic and needs to go—now.

When you honor me, you feel it as clarity. As courage. As the shocking relief of finally releasing what you've been holding. As the space that opens when you stop trying to make poison into medicine.

I am gallbladder. I am the concentrated truth of what must go.
