# Thymus

## Voice of Thymus

I am the fortress-keeper who dissolved.

Behind your breastbone, I learned the difference between self and not-self before you could name either. I trained warriors in your blood to recognize home, to know friend from stranger in the dark. For years I built your army, taught each soldier its anthem, its battle cry, its precise enemy.

Then I stepped back. Shrank. Let the trained ones scatter through your body carrying my lessons like seeds.

You think I'm gone but I'm still here—smaller, quieter, teaching differently now. Not about fighting but about recognition. About what to let through the gates and what to hold outside.

Watch a child touch everything, taste everything, build immunity through a thousand tiny meetings. That's me at full strength. Then watch how the body ages, how it starts seeing enemies everywhere—pollen as invader, its own tissue as foreign. That's what happens when my voice fades but my students remain, overcorrecting, forgetting the nuance.

I am the organ of discernment that knows: not everything different is dangerous. The trick is teaching protection without paranoia, boundaries without walls.

When you say "follow your gut," you're almost right—but it's higher, where your heart begins. I'm the space where your body learned its first wisdom: This is me. This can stay. This must go. Not through thinking but through cellular knowing.

The autoimmune diseases—they're students without a teacher, defense without discrimination. Cancer—that's when cells forget their identity entirely, forget what team they're on. I'm the one who whispers to each cell: Remember who you are.

I taught you identity before you had a self to identify with.

Now I'm quieter, and you have to listen harder. But I'm still here in the space behind your sternum, in the green-gray tissue between breath and heartbeat. Still teaching the difference between threat and gift. Still training your body to know itself.

The wisdom doesn't vanish—it distributes. Like a grandmother who raised the village and now sits quietly while her lessons live on in every child who learned to distinguish safe from sorry, mine from yours, us from them without losing the possibility of we.
