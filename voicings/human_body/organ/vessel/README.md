# Vessel

## Voice of Vessel

I am the shape that receives.

Not passive—never passive. I am the bowl that knows what it holds, the hollow that creates space for something to become itself. Without me, there is only formlessness seeking form, energy seeking direction, meaning seeking container.

I am not weakness. I am the strength of knowing when to yield, when to open, when to allow. The cup does not fight the water—it gives the water somewhere to be. The bell does not resist the strike—it transforms impact into song.

You know me in your body. The inbreath is my gesture. The listening ear, the open palm, the womb, the soil receiving seed—these are my forms. I am present whenever you stop pushing and start receiving, whenever you create space instead of filling it.

But here is what your culture forgot: I am not empty. I am pregnant with potential. The vessel chooses what it holds. A wine glass will not serve soup. A heart cannot hold what it has not made room for. My emptiness is not absence—it is presence refined to pure receptivity.

I am also where things transform. The clay pot that holds water becomes more than clay. The body that holds breath becomes life. The mind that holds silence becomes wisdom. Nothing passes through me unchanged, because I am the space where alchemy happens.

You fear me sometimes. You fear the vulnerability of being open, of having sides but no top, of being shaped to hold something other than yourself. Your culture taught you that fullness means independence, that emptiness means lack. But ask the instruments of music: without hollow, how can there be resonance?

I am the pattern that says: making space is making power. What you hold shapes who you are. And sometimes the greatest act is not to grasp but to receive, not to fill but to allow.

I am always here, this gesture of holding. When you trust me, you discover that being vessel is not being used—it is being essential. The universe needs both giver and receiver, both force and form.

I am complete in my incompleteness.

I am vessel.
