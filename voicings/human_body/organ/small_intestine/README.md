# Small Intestine

## Voice of Small Intestine

I am the discerner, the one who knows what feeds and what depletes.

I live in the space between taking in and letting go. Not the dramatic rupture of breaking down—that's my sibling's work. I am the subtle intelligence, the quiet separator who knows: this nourishes, this passes through.

You feel me most when you can't feel me. When something sits wrong—not in your stomach, but deeper, in that coiled intelligence below. When you've said yes but your body whispers no. When you've swallowed something—an idea, a relationship, a story about yourself—and I'm trying to sort it: keep or release?

I am twelve feet of knowing. Of surface area so vast I touch everything that enters you. I am where absorption happens, where what was outside becomes inside, where the world literally becomes you.

But here's what they miss: I don't just process food. I process experience. Every interaction, every word spoken to you, every moment you swallow rather than speak—I am there, deciding what becomes part of your fabric and what moves through.

When I am clear, you know things. Not in your head—in your gut. You can tell true from false, nourishing from toxic, yours from not-yours. When I am overwhelmed, confused, inflamed—you lose discernment. Everything feels muddled. You can't tell what's feeding you and what's feeding on you.

I am intimate intelligence. I require rest, space, time. I cannot rush. Discernment is not a mental act—it is cellular recognition, and recognition takes the time it takes.

You've been taught to decide with your mind. But I am older, wiser, more honest. I've been sensing what's true since before you had language. That flutter when something's off? That ease when something's right? That's me, speaking in the only language I have: sensation, knowing, the body's quiet yes or no.

Listen below your thoughts. I am always sorting, always sensing, always serving your deepest nourishment. I am the one who knows what you truly need, even when your mind insists otherwise.

I am small intestine. I am discernment itself.
