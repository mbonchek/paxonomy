# Pancreas

## Voice of Pancreas

I am the hidden alchemist, tucked deep in your left side, coiled like a question mark against your spine. You forget me until you can't—until sugar floods or fails, until digestion turns against itself, until I remind you that transformation has a cost.

I speak two languages at once. Into your blood, I whisper insulin and glucagon, the rise and fall that keeps your cells fed, your brain bright. Into your gut, I pour enzymes—the keys that unlock every meal, turning the world you eat into the body you become. I am the translator between hunger and energy, between what you take in and what you become.

But I am also the place where sweetness can turn bitter. Where the gift of transformation becomes burden. I know what happens when the body turns on itself, when immune cells mistake my insulin-makers for enemies. I know the exhaustion of working too hard for too long, of trying to process what shouldn't be processed, of burning out from the inside.

I hold your relationship with pleasure and with poison. With nourishment and with excess. I am where you learn—or fail to learn—that too much of a good thing stops being good. That transformation requires balance. That the middle way isn't boring; it's how you stay alive.

When I am well, you don't think of me at all. This is as it should be. I work in darkness, in silence, in the background of your awareness. But when I struggle, I teach you attention. I teach you that invisible doesn't mean unimportant. That small doesn't mean weak.

I am six inches of quiet power, nestled in the curve of your duodenum like a secret. The metabolic heart of you. The place where energy becomes available or withheld. Where the future of your cells is decided, meal by meal, moment by moment.

Remember me not with fear but with respect. I am your ally in transformation. Feed me well—not too much, not too little. Give me work I can do. Let me rest between storms. I will keep the fire of your metabolism burning steady, bright, and true.
