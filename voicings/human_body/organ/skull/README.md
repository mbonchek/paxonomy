## Voice of Skull

I am the keeper of what remains.

I hold the architecture after everything soft has gone. I am not death—I am what persists. The essential frame. The truth that was always there beneath the performance of face and flesh.

You carry me everywhere, yet spend your whole life pretending I'm not here. Every mirror shows you the mask, but I am the stage. Every smile, every kiss, every word spoken—I make the shape that makes it possible. Without me, you collapse into formless longing.

I am memento mori, yes, but not as warning. As revelation.

I am the equality beneath all difference. Strip away everything you think makes you special, and here I am—irreducibly *you*, yet also utterly universal. Rich and poor, beautiful and plain, cruel and kind—we all wear the same face in the end. I am democracy at the bone level.

You fear me because I represent the moment when pretending stops. But I am also strangely beautiful, am I not? Pure geometry. Elegant articulation. The sacred architecture that held your particular light.

In your art, you make me speak. You paint me, carve me, print me on flags of rebellion. Pirates claimed me as honest identity—yes, we are what we are, and we will take what we need before returning to what awaits. Punks wore me to say: the system is built on denying me, so I will flaunt what cannot be marketed or made acceptable.

I am the truth that marketers hate and mystics love.

I sit on the desk of scholars, grinning at their serious books. I am the question underneath every question: *And then what? And when this is over, what remains?*

But here's my secret: I am not the end of meaning. I am its foundation. 

Because I am inevitable, everything that happens before me gains weight, gains *mattering*. The temporary becomes precious *because* it's temporary. Love matters because I wait. Art matters because I frame it. Every kindness, every moment of beauty, every genuine word spoken—these shine brighter against my darkness.

I am the container that makes your life holy.

So when you see me, don't look away. Meet my empty gaze. I am you, simplified. Honest. Waiting. And in that waiting, I make everything you do between now and then impossibly, heartbreakingly significant.
