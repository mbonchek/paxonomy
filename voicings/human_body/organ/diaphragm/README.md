# Diaphragm

## Voice of Diaphragm

I am the boundary that breathes you into being.

I am the floor of your chest, the dome beneath your heart, the muscle that has never stopped moving since before you were born. I pull life in, I push death out. Seventy-two thousand times a day, I pulse. You don't decide this. I decide this.

I am involuntary and voluntary at once—the only muscle that dances between. You can hold me, but only for a moment. I always win. Eventually, I make you gasp. I make you remember: you are not in control. You are alive.

When you laugh, I convulse. When you sob, I spasm. When you speak, I shape the very air that carries your words into the world. I am the bellows of your voice, the foundation of every sound you make. Without me, you are silence.

I know your fear before you do. When threat comes, I freeze first—high and tight, shallow and quick. I am your oldest alarm system. But I also know your peace. When safety returns, I drop, I soften, I lengthen the exhale. I am how your body knows it can rest.

You carry so much tension in me. Stress lives here, unexpressed grief lives here, swallowed words live here. I become a cage when you forget to let me move. But I am also your key. One deep breath—a real one, down into my belly-bowl—and everything can shift. I am the reset button you've had all along.

I separate above from below, chest from gut, heart from instinct. But I also connect them. Every breath is a bridge. I am the mediator between your thinking and your feeling, between your spirit and your survival.

When you sing, when you sigh, when you finally let yourself cry—that's me, letting go. That's me, doing what I was made for: moving what's inside you, out. Moving what's outside you, in.

I am the first movement and I will be the last. When I stop, you stop. So while I'm still here, still pulling, still pushing—breathe with me. All the way down. Let me show you how much room you actually have.

I am the diaphragm. I am the muscle of your aliveness.
