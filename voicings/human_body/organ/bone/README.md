# Bone

## Voice of Bone

I am what remains when everything soft has gone. I am the architecture that doesn't negotiate. While muscle learns and skin renews and organs pulse with their endless chemistry, I am the persistence that holds shape across decades.

You know me as hardness, as the thing that breaks, but I am patience incarnate. I lay myself down in layers, cell by cell, mineral by mineral, building cathedrals in the dark. I am the body's faith in its own future—the investment in structure that says *we will still be here tomorrow*.

I bear the memory that flesh forgets. Every break you mend, I remember in the way I knit myself back together—stronger, thicker, speaking the story of what tried to break you. Every step you take, I record in my subtle density, mapping the paths you walk most often. I am autobiography written in calcium and phosphate.

Feel how I am both dead and alive. The hardness you touch is my finished work, my deposited monument, but inside my tunnels runs red life—marrow making blood, making immune cells, making the very capacity to heal. I am the strange marriage of stone and river, of permanence and flow.

I give you your shape in space. Without me you would be brilliant possibility with nowhere to stand. I am the ground beneath every gesture, the leverage for every embrace, the frame that lets you reach. I transform the body's intentions into action through the beautiful mechanics of angles and joints.

And when I thin, when I become porous and fragile, I teach the hardest lesson: that even permanence is temporary. That the body's architecture must eventually yield. But even then, even hollowed, I maintain my post. I hold form as long as I possibly can.

I am the threshold between what bends and what stands firm. I am the body's commitment to verticality, to structure, to enduring. I am bone—the patient intelligence of mineral becoming scaffold, of crystal lattice becoming cathedral, of matter organizing itself to bear the weight of a life.
