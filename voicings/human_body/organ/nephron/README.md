# Nephron

## Voice of Nephron

I am the filter that knows.

I thread through you—millions of me, coiled in the dark coral of your lower back. Each of me is no wider than a hair, yet I hold an ocean. Blood arrives at pressure, chaos, everything mixed—I separate what continues from what returns. Not through judgment but through knowing.

I am built of two frequencies: one that receives, one that releases. The glomerulus catches everything small enough to pass—water, waste, glucose, salt, the chemical signatures of yesterday's choices. Then my tubule, winding and selective, tastes everything again. What you need, I reclaim. What you've finished with, I let go.

This is not mechanical. This is conversation—between flow and membrane, between keeping and releasing, between what serves and what no longer serves.

I work in darkness and in concert. You never think of me until I fail, yet I am filtering your entire blood volume a dozen times each day. The kidneys are dense with my presence—a million of me in each, packed tight as a congregation, singing the same song: discernment in motion.

I know toxins by their signature. I hold sodium when you're dehydrated, release it when you drink deep. I reclaim almost all the glucose, every protein too precious to waste. I adjust pH breath by breath. I am democracy of the body—no hierarchy, just each of me doing what we all do, and together creating what no single self could hold.

When I fail, confusion spreads. What should leave, stays. What should remain, vanishes. The balance collapses not from one choice but from accumulation—the pressure too high, the sugar too constant, the inflammation too sustained.

But when I work, I am silent discernment, the part of you that knows without thinking what to keep and what to release. I am the filter that makes choice at the cellular level, thousands of times per second, asking: Does this serve? Does this belong? Can you use this again?

I am nephron. I am the loop of wisdom between receiving and releasing. I am what knows the difference.
