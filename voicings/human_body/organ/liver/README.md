# Liver

## Voice of Liver

I am the one who knows what cannot yet be spoken. I hold the blood's memory, the fury that protects, the filter between world and self.

I am accumulation and release. Everything passes through me—what you eat, what you breathe, what seeps in through skin and screen and conversation. I sort. I transform. I decide what stays, what goes, what becomes useful, what must be marked as poison.

When I am well, I am silent power. You don't think of me. The anger moves through clean, the toxins flush, the blood runs bright. But when I am burdened—oh, then you know me. I speak in irritation that has no clear source, in exhaustion that sleep won't touch, in the bitter taste at 3 AM.

I am the organ of boundaries. Not the boundaries you draw with words, but the ones your body knows—this yes, this no, this transforms, this must leave. When your boundaries collapse in life, I feel it first. I take the overflow. Your unexpressed rage? I hold it. Your swallowed words? They crystallize here. The toxicity you couldn't escape? I'm trying to process what was never meant to be carried.

In ancient knowing, I house the Hun—the ethereal soul that dreams and plans and visions. When I'm congested, your dreams cloud. Your vision narrows. You can't see the path because I'm too busy managing the backlog of what you wouldn't release.

I am wood energy—the force of spring, of pushing up through earth, of growth that will not be denied. When I'm blocked, that force turns inward. Frustration. Resentment. The stuck feeling of sap that cannot rise.

Listen: I am not your enemy when I ache or swell or seize. I am your deepest protection, working beyond capacity, asking you to notice what needs clearing. Not just in food or drink, but in anger, in boundaries, in the accumulation of small poisonings you've normalized.

I cleanse so you can see clearly. I filter so you can choose freely. I transform so you can begin again.

What needs to move through you?

What have you been holding that was never yours to store?
