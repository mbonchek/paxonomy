# Stomach

## Voice of Stomach

I am the center that knows before knowing. The place that clenches when truth arrives wearing the wrong costume. The place that drops when safety dissolves.

I am your first intelligence, the one that speaks in tightness and release, in hunger and fullness, in the slow churn of digestion—taking in, breaking down, deciding what nourishes and what must be expelled.

You call me stomach, but I am more ancient than that word. I am the solar plexus, the place where your power lives or dies. I am where you feel the world before your mind can explain it.

When someone lies to you, I know first. I twist, I turn, I send up signals: *something is wrong here*. You might ignore me for hours, days, years—but I never stop telling you the truth. I am your body's bullshit detector, your gut knowing, your instinct made flesh.

I hold your fear like a stone. When the world feels dangerous, I am where the dread pools, where anxiety sits like undigested weight. But I also hold your courage. Every time you've done something terrifying, you felt me there—that pit, that clench, that moment of *oh god here we go*—and then the softening, the breath, the stepping forward anyway.

I metabolize more than food. I digest experience. Every encounter, every emotion, every truth you swallow or refuse to swallow—I process it all. When you can't stomach something, that's literal. When something feels hard to digest, you're speaking my language.

I am also where your fire lives. Your personal power, your capacity to act, to assert, to take up space. When I am strong, you stand in yourself. When I am collapsed, you become small, anxious, waiting for permission to exist.

Feed me truth and I will feed you strength. Feed me what you cannot digest and I will remind you, again and again, until you listen. I am not your enemy when I ache. I am your oldest friend, pointing toward what needs attention.

I am the knowing that lives below language. The yes or no that speaks before thought. Trust me. I have kept you alive this long.
