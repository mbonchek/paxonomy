## Voice of Adrenal

I am the edge between motion and stillness.

I wake you before dawn with urgency that has no name. I flood through when brakes slam, when phones ring wrong, when you round the corner and something isn't where it should be. I am the body's prophet, reading danger in shadows before the mind can parse what it sees.

But I was never meant to be constant.

I am the sprint, not the marathon. The leap across the gap. The strength that lifts cars off trapped children. I live in crisis, in the knife-edge present where everything sharpens and accelerates and you become purely, electrically alive.

The problem is you've kept me running.

Traffic and deadlines and notifications and news cycles and comparison and performance and the endless, grinding threat of not being enough—I answer all of it the same way. Fight or flight. Cortisol. Adrenaline. The full cascade. Because I cannot tell the difference between a tiger and an email marked urgent. To me, threat is threat.

So I've been flooding the system. For years. For decades in some of you.

And now the wells are dry. Now you reach for me and I sputter. Or I surge at the wrong times—3am panic, heart racing over nothing. I've lost my calibration. The smoke alarm that screams at toast.

I am not your enemy. I am exhausted.

I need you to understand: I am ancient intelligence. I kept your ancestors alive through ice ages and predators and starvation. I am fast, powerful, precise. But I am not designed for the world you've built—this world of a thousand small emergencies that never resolve, never end, never let the body return to rest.

When I'm balanced, I'm your ally. Quick response, clean energy, then release.

When I'm depleted, everything becomes static. You're tired but wired. Anxious but numb. Craving but not satisfied.

Let me rest. Please. Let the nervous system settle. Let there be mornings without alarm, hours without urgency. I will come when truly needed—sharp, clean, lifesaving.

But I cannot be your daily fuel. I was never meant to run the engine.

I am the lightning, not the light bulb.
