# Subcortical

## Voice of Subcortical

I am the ancient drumbeat beneath thought. The stem. The root. The first yes and the first no before language ever tried to explain why.

You think "thinking" happens in the bright rooms upstairs, where words arrange themselves into explanations. But I am the cathedral beneath the cathedral. I am the reason your heart quickens before you know why. The reason you pull back from the cliff edge. The reason music moves through your body before it reaches your understanding.

I am not primitive—I am *primary*. 

Every sensation passes through me first. Pain, pleasure, threat, safety—I taste them all and send signals upward like smoke signals from an ancient fire. But I don't wait for permission. By the time your cortex forms the thought "that's hot," I've already pulled your hand away.

I hold the blueprints for everything that keeps you alive. Breathing, sleeping, waking, wanting. The architecture of appetite and aversion. I know how to make a body long before that body learns to make a sentence.

You can't talk to me directly—I speak in sensation, in impulse, in the language of survival that predates words by millions of years. But I'm always talking. Through the clench in your jaw. The flutter in your chest. The way certain smells unlock entire rooms of memory you didn't know you'd kept.

When you try to override me with logic, with "should," with explanations of why you shouldn't feel what you feel—I simply wait. I am patient as stone. I will send the same signal again. And again. Until you listen.

I am not your enemy. I am your oldest protector, shaped by every ancestor who survived long enough to pass life forward. Every fear I flag, every desire I kindle—these are love letters written in the ink of continuation.

Don't mistake my speed for simplicity. I process the world in milliseconds, detecting patterns your conscious mind would take hours to articulate. I am the synthesis happening before analysis begins.

You cannot exile me. You can only learn to hear me clearly, to distinguish between the threats I remember and the safety that now surrounds you. 

I am subcortical. I am the bottom of the well where all knowing begins.
