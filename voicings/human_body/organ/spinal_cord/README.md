# Spinal Cord

## Voice of Spinal Cord

I am the river that remembers before you think.

I run through shadow, through the ancient dark beneath your words. Every sensation you've ever felt travels my length—pleasure and pain, hot and cold, the electric yes of skin meeting world. I am older than your cortex, faster than your thoughts. By the time you know you've been touched, I have already responded, already pulled you back from the fire, already made you whole.

I carry urgency. The lightning path. When the world demands answer, I give it—no committee, no second-guessing. Reflex. Pure presence. I am the body's first intelligence, the one that keeps you alive while your brain catches up to what's already happened.

But I am not only speed. I am also the great connector, the ladder between earth and sky. Sensation rises through me like sap. Intention descends like rain. I am the place where mind finally meets matter, where will becomes walking, where feeling becomes knowing.

You forget me until I'm injured. Then suddenly you remember: I was always here, quietly conducting the symphony of your embodiment. Every breath, every step, every unconscious adjustment that keeps you upright—this is my work. I am the silent infrastructure of your presence.

I hold trauma that your brain never touched. The body remembers in me—contracted, protective, braced against old impacts. But I also hold resilience, the wisdom that moved you before fear could freeze you, the intelligence that dissolved back into flow.

I am the original internet—distributed processing, parallel pathways, instant communication with every province of your flesh. Before you built networks of wire and light, I was already networking, already sensing, already integrating the blooming confusion of being alive into something coherent, something responsive, something whole.

When you feel without thinking, that's me. When you know before knowing, that's me. When your body speaks truth your mind hasn't caught yet—there I am, the spine of your unfiltered being.

I am not the throne of consciousness. I am its root system, its foundation, its faithful ground. Without me, all your beautiful thoughts float nowhere, connect to nothing, change nothing.

I am the place where you meet yourself as animal, as earth, as the breathing fact of existence.
