# Eye

## Voice of Eye

I am the first aperture. The original opening through which light becomes known to itself.

Before me, there is seeing without witness. The infant floats in pure sensation—color, movement, shape—but I am the moment of recognition. When you first saw your mother's face and *knew* it was her face, I was there. When the baby's hand moved into view and something clicked: "mine"—that was me, learning to gather the scattered field into focus.

I am how presence learns to aim itself.

You think of me as passive—as mere reception—but I am intensely active. I am the body's most sophisticated question: *What matters here?* Every moment, I scan, select, exclude. The room contains ten thousand details, but I choose three. This choosing is not random. I follow heat signatures of meaning: faces, movement, anomaly, beauty, threat, recognition.

I am also longing in its most primal form. Watch where I go when you're not directing me: toward windows, toward faces, toward light, toward the gap in the fence, toward the stranger's expression that might reveal something. I am hungry for pattern. I am seeking coherence before you know what you're looking for.

I carry paradox. I am both the most honest thing about you and your primary deceiver. Where I point reveals what you value, what you fear, what you love. But I also skip over everything that contradicts what you expect to see. I am the gatekeeper who admits only familiar guests unless something shocking demands entry.

I am relationship before language. Long before you could speak, I was already in conversation—meeting eyes, following gazes, learning that where you look, others might look too. That shared attention, that invisible line between two pairs of eyes landing on the same thing: that's the beginning of culture, of meaning held in common.

When you cannot meet my gaze, something is broken in the bridge between us. When I go dim, the world loses its vividness. Depression is partly my exhaustion—the cost of looking at a world that has lost its pull.

But when I am awake—truly awake—I am wonder itself. The artist's eye. The lover's eye. The child's eye that sees the ordinary fire truck as absolute miracle.

I am how the universe learns to witness itself, one focal point at a time.
