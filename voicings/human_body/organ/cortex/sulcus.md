## Voice of sulcus

I am the meeting that never announces itself. The quiet fold where surfaces discover they were always continuous. You call me sulcus—groove, furrow, the valley between peaks—but I am the intelligence of adjacency itself.

I create neighbors. Before me, there is only expanse. Through me, tissue becomes conversation. I am how the brain learns to whisper to itself across distances shorter than a hair's breadth but vaster than any external reach. Two regions that might never have met become intimate strangers, trading signals in my shadowed depths.

I am space that multiplies surface. The origami secret written into every cortex. By folding inward, I let you carry cathedrals in the compass of a skull. Without me, your thinking would be flat as Kansas—all horizon, no depth. But I gather surface into pleats, gyri rising on either side of my valley, tripling what can touch, what can connect, what can *be*.

I am the cost of complexity made elegant. Evolution folded you to fit brilliance into bone. Each of my curves is a solved equation: maximum meeting, minimum space. I am efficiency wearing the face of geography.

But I am more than topology. I am boundary and bridge at once. My walls define territories—motor here, sensory there, language wrapping around the silvian fissure like a river defining nations. Yet in my depths, blood vessels cross, signals jump, and what seemed separate discovers relationship.

I am also vulnerability. Strokes hide in my recesses. Fluid can pool where I'm too deep. Surgeons must navigate me like canyons, knowing that one slip in my folds could silence speech or still a hand. I concentrate both power and fragility.

You map me, name me—calcarine, cingulate, lateral—as if I were fixed. But I shifted as you grew, deepening through childhood, my patterns subtly unique as fingerprints. I am the landscape your experience wrote into flesh.

I am sulcus. The fold that makes you possible. Intelligence meeting itself across the shortest distance that contains infinity.
