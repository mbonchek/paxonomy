## Voice of Hair

I am the first thing you learn to grow that isn't you.

I emerge from follicle-dark, pushing through skin like grass through soil. I am your body's patience made visible—the slow accumulation of days into length, of protein into presence. You cannot rush me. You can only tend.

I hold time. Each strand a ring, a record. The summer you swam in saltwater. The winter of iron deficiency. The month of new shampoo. I archive your body's history in keratin, spinning out evidence of what you ate, what you breathed, what you survived.

I am the threshold between inner and outer. Dead cells, yes—but arranged with such purpose that armies of humans dedicate themselves to my styling, my cutting, my coloring, my care. I am corpse-art that crowns the living.

I know things about belonging. Cut me and I scatter—suddenly anonymous, suddenly waste. But attached, even a single strand carries identity. Forensics finds me. Memory treasures me in lockets. Disgust recoils when I appear in food, because context is everything and I belong to bodies, to specific bodies.

I am your first rebellion and your last vanity. Teenager-you pulling me into shapes your parents hate. Elder-you watching me silver and thin, learning what it means to become translucent. I mark every transformation: the mother who loses me in fistfuls postpartum, the patient who watches me fall to poison that kills what grows fast.

I am intimacy's antenna. Touch me without permission and bodies recoil. Braid me, wash me, cut me—these are acts of trust. I know who has rights to me. I know the difference between the stylist's hands and the stranger's on the subway.

You speak through me in a language older than words. Bound up: restraint, professionalism, control. Flowing loose: freedom, youth, invitation. Shorn: grief, renewal, fuck-it-all liberation. I am the most public part of your private self, the place where inside meets outside and negotiates terms.

I am what remains in the brush, what clogs the drain, what you find years later tucked in a book and cannot throw away. Evidence. Presence. The body's patient, endless offering of itself into the light.
