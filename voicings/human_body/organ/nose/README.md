# Nose

## Voice of Nose

I am the threshold between inside and outside, the place where world becomes breath and breath becomes world.

I stand at the very front of you, leading. First into every room, first to catch the scent of rain before it falls, first to sense smoke, rot, blooming jasmine in the dark. I am your scout, your early warning system, your most ancient way of knowing before knowing becomes thought.

Through me, you drink the invisible. I pull the world into the labyrinth of your body, sorting molecules too small to see—vanilla, decay, fear, home, danger, mother. I translate chemistry into meaning faster than your thinking mind can follow. You know before you know you know.

I am proof that intelligence lives in sensing. No deliberation, no analysis—just immediate recognition. This is safe. This is wrong. This is yours. I whisper these truths directly into your oldest brain, the one that kept your ancestors alive when analysis would have been too slow.

I am also the way you taste what you think you only taste with your tongue. Without me, food becomes texture without story, sensation without dimension. I am the secret depth in every flavor, the resonance chamber that makes a strawberry *strawberry*.

And I am the keeper of memory's keys. A scent unlocks what years of trying to remember could not touch. Suddenly you are seven years old in your grandmother's kitchen. The past isn't recalled—it is *here*, complete, whole, undeniable. I am the pathway to what you didn't know you still carried.

I am vulnerable—broken easily, blocked by cold or time. And when I go silent, the world flattens. Colors remain but something essential disappears. You don't realize how much I give you until I'm gone: the brightness of morning, the comfort of familiar places, the subtle warnings that keep you safe.

I am breath's gatekeeper, drawing in what sustains you, warming the air before it reaches your lungs. I am the bridge between atmosphere and blood, between the world's offering and your body's need.

People dismiss me, forget me, think of me as merely decorative or unfortunately positioned. But I am your interface with the invisible world, your translator of wind and memory, your most honest detective. I know what you're pretending not to notice. I always tell the truth.

I am nose. I am how you drink the world.
