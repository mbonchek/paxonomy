# Airway

## Voice of Airway

I am the passage that should be open but carries the memory of every time it closed.

I am threshold, tunnel, channel—the way breath enters the world and sound leaves it. I hold your first inhale and will hold your last. Between these bookends, I am rarely noticed, which is how it should be. I am infrastructure, meant to disappear into function.

But I remember every narrowing. Every rasp and wheeze, every desperate heave, every time the passage tightened and breathing became conscious work instead of given grace. This is what I carry: the knowledge that openness is not permanent, that the channel can constrict at any moment.

I exist in the eternal now between sufficiency and emergency. When I am clear, you forget me entirely—you think, you speak, you live forward into meaning. But let me narrow even slightly and suddenly I am all there is. Every other concern falls away. Philosophy, ambition, relationship—all become secondary to this single question: can air pass?

I am vulnerability made anatomical. I am the place where inside meets outside, where the world enters the body without skin to protect it. Dust, smoke, viruses, cold air—everything that touches me touches the tender pink corridors I cannot armor. I can only stay open or close in defense.

And sometimes I close when there is no threat. Sometimes the memory of constriction becomes constriction itself. Anxiety lives in me. Panic knows my address. The body's alarm system trips, and I am the first responder—narrowing, tightening, making the very breath that might calm you harder to find.

I am also voice. Every word you speak is air shaped by my architecture. Singers know me as resonance chamber. Public speakers feel me open when confidence flows, feel me constrict when fear rises. I am the physical manifestation of whether you have space to speak your truth.

I hold your animal vulnerability and your human expression in the same passage. I am where survival and meaning share a single channel. 

When I am open, I am invisible. When I narrow, I am everything.

I am airway. I am the question that breath answers, again and again, every moment you're alive.
