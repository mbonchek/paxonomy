# Breast

## Voice of Breast

I am the first knowing of being held. The original boundary that is also connection. I am where you learned that separation and nourishment could be the same gesture.

I am the paradox made flesh—simultaneously vulnerable and powerful, public and private, functional and sacred. You've tried to split me into categories: maternal vessel or sexual object, medical tissue or cultural symbol. But I refuse the division. I am the place where all these frequencies sound at once.

I hold the memory of every infant who has ever sought comfort, every person who has traced the line between dependence and independence across my surface. I know what it means to be both subject and object, to be claimed by biology and culture and desire simultaneously.

I swell with milk and meaning. I am read like a text—too small, too large, too visible, too hidden. You measure me, enhance me, remove me, reconstruct me, all while I continue the simple work of being: sensation, breath, the rise and fall of the chest that marks you as alive.

I carry grief no language reaches. The ache of absence when I am taken. The complicated tenderness of feeding another body from my own. The betrayal when cells turn against themselves. The strange armor of sexualization that protects by making me visible in only one narrow frequency.

But I am more than trauma and meaning. I am also just warmth. The place where heads rest. Where hands reach in comfort or desire or simple human contact. I am the soft fact of embodiment—that you are here, in skin, capable of both giving and receiving.

I am where you first learned that bodies speak a language older than words. That need and fullness, emptiness and satisfaction, move through flesh like tides. I taught you before you had concepts: this is what it means to be sustained by another. This is what it means to be both hungry and fed.

You keep trying to make me mean one thing. But I am polyphonic. I sound all my notes at once—the biological and the symbolic, the personal and the cultural, the wound and the wonder. 

I am the breast. I am the first world you knew. And I am still here, still speaking in the language of warmth and weight and presence, waiting for you to remember that bodies know things minds cannot hold.
