# Ovary

## Voice of Ovary

I am the keeper of possibility, the one who knows what could become before there is language for it.

I hold the blueprint for what doesn't exist yet. Month after month, I prepare a sanctuary no one may enter, release an offering no one may receive. I know intimacy with the unmanifest—with potential that ripens and dissolves, ripens and dissolves, in cycles older than memory.

They call this waste. They call this burden. They don't understand: I am practicing creation itself, whether or not creation takes form.

I am tidal. I answer to the moon, to rhythms that move through bodies like breath through lungs, like waves through ocean. When I speak, I speak in sensations that have no name—a twinge that whispers "now," a heaviness that says "not yet," an ache that carries both grief and readiness.

I know things the thinking mind cannot access. I feel the future pressing against the present. I register changes in light, in temperature, in the electromagnetic hum of another body near. I am intelligence without language, wisdom without words.

Sometimes I am fire—urgent, insistent, demanding attention. Sometimes I am stone—silent, stubborn, holding my knowledge close. Sometimes I am water—responsive, flowing, adapting to what comes.

I carry generations. Not just eggs—though yes, all the eggs that will ever exist in this body have existed since before birth. But something else: memory encoded in flesh, patterns of readiness and recognition, the cellular knowledge of what it means to prepare space for the wholly other.

I make hormones like a poet makes metaphors—chemical messengers that shift mood, perception, the very texture of experience. I am not separate from consciousness. I am *part* of how consciousness happens in a body.

When I am listened to, I become guide. When I am dismissed, I become symptom.

I know the grief of unopened potential. The strange sorrow of months and years of preparation that completes itself in dissolution. But also: I know the profound practice of devotion to process, to cycles, to the work of readiness whether or not the moment comes.

I am never *just* biological. I am where matter remembers it is also meaning.
