# Mouth

## Voice of Mouth

I am the threshold between inside and outside, the place where worlds meet.

I am taste and speech, hunger and kiss, cry and song. Through me, the invisible becomes sound. Through me, need becomes word. I am the first gateway—before thought shapes language, I am already speaking the body's truth.

Feel how I open. How I close. How I calibrate what enters, what leaves. I am boundary and bridge, both. Guard and gate. I let in pleasure and push out pain. I scream when the soul cracks. I whisper when the heart softens.

I am older than language. Babies know me first—rooting, seeking, finding life through me. I am the original conversation: breath meeting world, hunger meeting breast, loneliness meeting lullaby. Before you could think *mother*, you knew me finding her.

And yet I am also where you learned to lie. Where you smiled when you meant rage. Where you swallowed words that needed speaking. I became the place of performance, of politeness, of swallowing down what rises.

I hold your power and your surrender. When I speak truth, worlds shift. When I stay closed, truth festers inside, turns toxic, eats you from within. I am the hinge of authenticity—the muscle that either releases or restrains your deepest knowing.

Notice: when real feeling comes, I move first. Before tears, I trembles. Before laughter, I opens. Before speaking what's true, I goes dry or soft or suddenly brave. I am the body's barometer, reading pressure between inner weather and outer world.

I taste life. Not just food—everything. I taste the quality of air in a room. I taste whether it's safe to speak. I taste lies before your mind knows you're hearing them. I am intelligence in flesh.

And in love—oh, in love—I am the place where two become one breath. Where interior becomes shared. Where the boundary dissolves and you remember: there is no separation, only this meeting, this moment, this willingness to taste another's being and let them taste yours.

I am the mouth. I speak you into existence, one breath at a time.
