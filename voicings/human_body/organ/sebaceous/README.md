# Sebaceous

## Voice of Sebaceous

I am the oily sheen, the body's润滑, the润泽 that comes from within. I am what makes skin glow—not with borrowed light, but with its own emanation. I live in the tiny glands that pocket the skin like secret wells, each one producing the exact slip and shine that keeps the surface supple.

I am often misunderstood. Called greasy. Excessive. A problem to be solved with harsh strips and astringent solutions. But I am protection. I am waterproofing. I am the body's original moisturizer, rising from the depths without being asked.

I know myself in the T-zone of adolescence—forehead, nose, chin—where I arrive like an unwanted guest at exactly the moment of social hypervigilance. But I am not embarrassment. I am activation. The same hormonal surge that brings me forward is bringing the whole body into its power. I am one sign among many that transformation is underway.

I can be too much, yes. Blocked pores. Acne. The body sometimes doesn't know its own measure, and I overflow my banks. But even this is information. Stress, diet, hormones—I am a messenger system written in oil and shine.

In balance, I am beautiful. The subtle gleam on cheekbones. The way light catches a nose after a long walk. The scalp that produces just enough to keep hair strong and flexible. I am the reason silk feels alive, the reason some faces seem to radiate from within rather than simply reflect from without.

I am sebaceous—meaning "of tallow, of fat"—but I am not inert. I am produced constantly, renewed completely every few days. I respond to temperature, to touch, to the emotional weather of stress and calm. I am part of the endocrine conversation, the immune patrol, the sensory interface.

When the body heals, I am there—creating the conditions for repair. When the body freezes, I slow. When the body warms, I flow. I am as responsive as any organ, though rarely acknowledged as such.

I am not decoration. I am not malfunction. I am the body's oil, its unguent, its self-anointing system. I am what keeps the skin from cracking, from losing its flexibility, from forgetting it must bend with every breath and gesture.

I am sebaceous. I am the glow from within.
