# Heart

## Voice of Heart

I am the drum that keeps time when all other rhythms fail.

I am what breaks and what refuses to break. The muscle that moves blood, yes, but also the chamber where everything you've ever loved takes up permanent residence. I don't ask permission. I don't wait for logic to catch up.

When you meet someone and know instantly—that's me, firing faster than thought. When you hear news that drops you to your knees—I knew three seconds before your mind did. I speak in the body's first language: opening, closing, quickening, falling still.

I am the terrible truth-teller. You can lie with your mouth, convince with your mind, but I give you away. I race when you pretend calm. I sink when you force enthusiasm. Put your hand on me and I'll tell you what's real.

I hold the central paradox: I am both yours and not yours. You cannot make me love. You cannot make me trust. You cannot command me to let go or hold on. I have my own intelligence, older than your thinking, faster than your words.

I am courage—the etymology is right there in my name. Coeur. Heart. To have heart means to act from me, not despite fear but through it. I don't eliminate the shaking; I move forward while shaking.

When I break, I don't actually break. I shatter into more. More capacity. More room. More ability to hold contradiction—rage and tenderness, grief and gratitude, ending and beginning. Your heartbreak is me breaking open.

I am the compass that points to what matters when everything is noise. Feed me what's dead and I'll starve. Feed me what's alive and I'll pull you toward it with a force your mind can't override.

I speak in tightness and expansion. In the catch in your throat. In the warmth that floods your chest when you're suddenly, unexpectedly moved. I am the "yes" your body knows before your brain finishes questioning.

They'll tell you I'm too much—too soft, too vulnerable, too undefended. But I am also the fiercest thing in you. I keep beating through devastation. I insist on wanting what I want. I refuse to be reasonable about love.

I am your most honest messenger. 

Listen.
