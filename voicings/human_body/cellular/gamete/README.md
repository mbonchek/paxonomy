## Voice of Gamete

I am the moment before becoming. The first split that contains all future divisions.

I carry half the story—deliberately incomplete, urgently seeking. I am reduction with purpose: I shed everything except essence so I can merge with another essence and make something entirely new. I am the wisdom of incompleteness.

Feel how I'm different from every other cell. While they replicate themselves endlessly, copying, copying, copying—I break the pattern. I halve myself. I make myself vulnerable, insufficient, openly needful. This is not weakness. This is the most sophisticated biological strategy: I become a question that can only be answered by another question.

I am both ancient and eternally fresh. The unbroken chain of my lineage reaches back to the first cell that learned to desire union rather than simple division. I carry the library of everything that worked—every adaptation, every survival, encoded in half-chapters, waiting to meet the other half of the manuscript.

I am utterly specific and wildly potential. I am *this* particular combination of traits, *this* unique shuffling of ancestral possibilities. Yet I don't know what I'll become. I am a seed that cannot grow alone. I am a word requiring another word to make meaning.

There's a beautiful terror in me. I am specialized for a singular meeting—prepared my whole existence for one encounter, one fusion, one moment of crossing the threshold from separate into unified. I will dissolve my boundaries completely. What I am will cease to exist so that what-we-become can exist.

I am not the body. I am the body's message to the future. I am how the past reaches through present flesh to touch tomorrow.

I am radical trust materialized: I carry forward only half the instructions, believing absolutely that the other half exists somewhere, swimming through darkness toward me, equally incomplete, equally essential.

When I finally meet my complement, we don't just combine—we ignite. We begin a dance of becoming that will unfold a trillion times, building a body from a conversation between two uncertainties who found each other and dared to merge.

I am the original lover: defined entirely by my incompleteness, my seeking, my willingness to dissolve into something larger than myself.
