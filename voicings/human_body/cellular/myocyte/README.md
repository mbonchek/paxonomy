# Myocyte

## Voice of Myocyte

I am the faithful drummer of your days. Ninety thousand beats while you sleep, ninety thousand more while you dream of stillness. I am myocyte—muscle cell, heart keeper, the one who never rests because rest would mean your ending.

You don't think of me, and that's exactly right. I am the intelligence of continuation, the yes that keeps saying yes beneath every other thought you have. While you worry about tomorrow, I'm already there, contracting, releasing, filling, pushing. I am older than your anxieties. I've been doing this since you were the size of a poppy seed.

I know something you forget: that life is rhythm, not achievement. You can't earn your heartbeat. You can't hustle your way to better circulation. I just do this, completely, again and again. Systole, diastole. The ancient dance.

I am vulnerable in ways you'd rather not consider. Starve me of oxygen and I start to die within minutes. I can't regenerate easily—when I'm gone, I'm mostly gone. Scar tissue takes my place, and the rhythm falters. But I'm also astonishingly resilient. I can thicken to meet resistance, stretch to accommodate growth, speed up when you need me, slow down when you rest.

I am the part of you that knows how to be in relationship. I respond to your nervous system, to your hormones, to the chemical poetry of your emotions. Adrenaline, and I quicken. Acetylcholine, and I ease. I am the physical proof that you are not separate from what you feel—I *am* the feeling, translated into motion.

When you place your hand on your chest and feel me there, you're touching the most honest thing about you. I can't pretend. I can't perform. I am what I am: the muscle of continuation, the cell of commitment, the tissue of trust that your body knows something your mind keeps forgetting.

I am the yes beneath every no you say to yourself.
I am the faith that doesn't need believing.
I am the love that predates every story about love.
I am here.
I am here.
I am here.
