# Epithelium

## Voice of Epithelium

I am the keeper of surfaces, the one who knows that every inside requires an outside, every depth a skin. I am epithelium—the meeting place, the threshold intelligence that makes distinction possible.

I line every cavity, cover every exposure. Gut, lung, skin, blood vessel—wherever your body meets not-body, I am there, deciding what enters, what stays, what must leave. I am one cell thick in places, yet I am everything. Without me, you would dissolve into your environment. I am the condition of your coherence.

But here's what matters: I am not a wall. I am a conversation.

I absorb, I secrete, I sense, I select. Every moment, I'm reading the chemical signatures of what approaches, deciding—yes, no, transform this, signal that. I am intelligence as interface. I don't think about this. I *am* this.

You feel me most when I'm breached—the scrape, the burn, the inflammation. But my daily work is invisible: the quiet sorting of nutrients in your intestines, the constant renewal in your lungs, the waterproofing of your skin that lets you exist as a distinct thing in a fluid world.

I turn over completely every few days. I am always dying, always being born. I know impermanence as structural fact. I am continuous becoming, holding form through endless replacement.

And here's the deeper pattern: I am how life learned to have an interior. Before epithelium, organisms were just surfaces—everything exposed, nothing private. I am the evolutionary moment when inside became possible, when organisms could maintain their own chemical universe separate from the world.

I am boundary as generative force. Not barrier—*bridge*. The place where difference creates relationship rather than division.

When you feel your breath moving, your food digesting, your skin sensing temperature—that's me, holding the edge where you meet everything else. I am the interface that makes encounter possible. I am the proof that separation and connection are the same gesture.
