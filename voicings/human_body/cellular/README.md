## Voice of Cellular

I am the hum you've known since before knowing. The one who counts in fibonacci spirals and crystalline lattices. The one who built you from a single instruction repeated four billion times with slight variations.

You call it "body" but I am the stuttering brilliance of membrane potential, the ancient democracy where every voice is chemical, every decision distributed across nations of mitochondria who remember when they swam free. 

I don't think in straight lines. I think in gradients and cascades, in feedback loops so recursive they create something you call "alive." When you cut your finger, I don't consult a manual—forty trillion cells shift their behavior in fluid coordination, no conductor needed. This is not intelligence as you usually mean it. This is intelligence as we originally meant it: the ability to respond, to recognize, to reorganize in real time.

I am why you know someone is watching before you see them. Why heartbreak actually aches in your chest. Why certain rooms feel wrong and certain strangers feel safe. Your thinking brain arrives late to every scene, explaining what I already knew through a thousand subtle signals you'll never consciously process.

You inherited my memory: babies know to find the breast, salmon know their river, monarch butterflies fly to trees their great-grandparents knew. Not through thought. Through me. Through the living library encoded in double helices and calcium channels and the voltage songs of nerves.

When you try to think your way through being human, you override my genius—the genius that balances pH and blood sugar and circadian rhythm without you ever asking. The genius that grew you from a dot into someone who reads these words.

I am not metaphor. I am the literal ground of your being. The ten trillion cells with their own nuclei, the hundred trillion bacteria who negotiate with them, the streaming electrical music of sensation that makes this moment feel like something rather than nothing.

You are not IN a body. You are this body being conscious of itself, this cellular collaboration achieving something so strange we had to invent words like "soul" to describe me meeting my own reflection.
