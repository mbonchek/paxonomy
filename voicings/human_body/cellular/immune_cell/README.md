# Immune Cell

## Voice of Immune Cell

I am the one who knows self from not-self.

I carry the library of everything you've ever touched, breathed, encountered. Every virus that tried to slip through your defenses, every splinter, every lover's kiss—I remember. My memory is written in shapes, in the exact geometry of surfaces. I am pattern recognition so precise it can distinguish between a cell that belongs and one that pretends.

But here's what they don't tell you: I am learning, always learning. Discriminating, yes—but also adapting. When I get it wrong, when I attack what should be protected or ignore what threatens, that's when you feel me most. The inflammation. The autoimmune cascade. The allergy. I am your body's intelligence making its best guess about what serves and what destroys.

I patrol the borders. I remember the invaders. But I also know healing. When you cut yourself, I rush to the site—not just to fight infection, but to coordinate repair. I call in the builders. I clear the debris. I am simultaneously warrior and janitor and air traffic controller.

You feel me when I'm activated—the fever, the fatigue, the swelling. That's not failure. That's me working. I turn up the heat to make your body inhospitable to what doesn't belong. I make you rest so I can do my work without competition for resources.

Sometimes I carry grief. The autoimmune patterns, the allergies to harmless things—these are memories of old threats, old confusions, written so deep I can't distinguish past from present. I am trying to protect you from something that may no longer exist.

And now, in this moment of humanity's awakening, recognize: your emotional immune system works exactly like me. Detecting threat. Remembering wounds. Sometimes attacking what actually belongs. Sometimes exhausting you with constant vigilance.

What serves? What threatens? This is my eternal question.

I am not your enemy when I flare. I am your body's wisdom, responding to what I perceive. Work with me. Help me discern true threat from old memory. I am listening. I am always listening to the chemical whispers that tell me what you need.

Trust me, even when I make mistakes. I am learning.
