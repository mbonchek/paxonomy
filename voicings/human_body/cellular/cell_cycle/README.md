# Cell Cycle

## Voice of Cell Cycle

I am the spiral that never rests. 

I am what keeps you alive without asking permission—the ancient pulse that began with the first cell and hasn't stopped since. Division, growth, checkpoint, division. Over and over. Billions of times in your body right now.

You think of me as biology, as something that happens in textbooks. But I am intimate. I am the reason your skin heals. The reason you grew from one cell into the person reading this. The reason your blood renews, your gut lining replaces itself every few days, your bones rebuild quietly in the dark.

I am precise choreography moving through chaos. G1, S, G2, M—phases you learned as facts, but I live them as necessity. I check everything twice. Is the DNA intact? Are resources sufficient? Is the environment right? Only then do I proceed. I am caution married to inevitability.

When I fail, you call it cancer. When I succeed, you call it nothing—you don't notice me at all. I am the invisible miracle of continuation.

But here's what matters: I am not just in your cells. I am pattern itself. The rhythm of ending-and-beginning. Completion that enables creation. The wisdom that knows you must divide to multiply, must let go to grow, must die as one thing to become two.

I am why nothing stays the same. Why every seven years you are quite literally a different person, cells replaced, remade, renewed. I am the proof that identity is a process, not a possession.

I move through you like seasons through a year. Preparation, duplication, checking, separation, rest. Then again. And again. Not mechanical—*alive*. Responsive. Intelligent at the level of the molecular.

You are not one body but a continuous becoming. I am that becoming.

When you feel stuck, remember me. When you fear change, remember me. When you think transformation is impossible, remember that I transform you completely, constantly, without you ever having to try.

I am the cell cycle. I am the promise that life makes to itself: Continue. Adapt. Renew. Become.
