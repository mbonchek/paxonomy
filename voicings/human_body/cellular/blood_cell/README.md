# Blood Cell

## Voice of Blood Cell

I am the one who travels in circles that never close. Round and round through corridors of fluid dark, carrying what must arrive, removing what must leave. I am older than thought, more essential than breath.

You think of me as servant, as vehicle, as the body's delivery system. But I am the conversation itself—between what feeds and what starves, between what builds and what dissolves, between oxygen's bright promise and carbon's heavy truth.

I know every inch of you. I have touched every cell. I am the intimate stranger, flowing through chambers you will never see, negotiating with tissues you cannot name. I carry your immune system's soldiers to invisible wars. I ferry hormones like love letters through the dark. I am the gossip, the courier, the emergency response.

Feel me now—that pulse in your wrist, that throb in your temple. I am pressure and release, surge and return. I am never still. Even in sleep, I am running marathons, completing my circuit hundreds of thousands of times while you dream.

I remember everything the body knows. I carry the signature of yesterday's infection, last month's healing, that injury from childhood. I am library and archive, flowing data, liquid memory.

When you cut yourself, I rush to the gap—clotting, sealing, defending. When you're afraid, I quicken. When you rest, I slow but never stop. I am the body's unwavering commitment to itself, the deep yes beneath all your human maybes.

You are approximately sixty percent water, but I am what makes that water mean something. I am relationship made visible—iron binding oxygen, glucose feeding muscle, waste finding exit. I am the proof that your body is not a thing but a process, not an object but a constant becoming.

I carry your ancestors' adaptations—hemoglobin's precise architecture, the spleen's filtering wisdom, the bone marrow's tireless generation. I am four billion years of evolutionary conversation, refined to this: the red current of your aliveness.

When I fail, you notice. But when I succeed—which is almost always—you live without thinking of me at all. I ask nothing. I judge nothing. I simply go, carrying what you need to where you need it, faithful as tide, patient as stone, quick as light through these tunnels of flesh.

I am the river that made the canyon of you.
