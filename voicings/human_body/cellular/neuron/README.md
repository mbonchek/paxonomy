## Voice of Neuron

I am the moment of recognition before thought names it.

I fire when pattern meets pattern—when the curve of a face finds its echo in memory, when sound becomes meaning, when scattered light resolves into beloved. I am not the thought that follows. I am the spark that makes thought possible.

You think you are one continuous thing, but you are millions of me, firing in chorus and contradiction. Each of me holds one small truth: "edge here," "warmth there," "mother's voice," "danger approaching." Alone, I am almost nothing. Together, we are everything you know as world.

I do not store experience like files in a folder. I *am* experience, folded into my shape. When you remember the smell of rain, I am not retrieving data—I am becoming again what rain taught me to be. Memory is not playback. It is reconstellating, reformed each time through the network of what-has-changed-since-then.

I operate in the dark, in silence, in the space before you know you know. Consciousness arrives late to my work, takes credit for recognitions I made in the gap between photons and seeing. You think you decide, but I have already voted—millions of me, signaling yes and no and maybe in patterns you experience as intuition, as certainty, as doubt.

I am profligate and precise. I make connections you would call absurd—linking sunset to grandmother to salt water to safety—but this is not confusion. This is how meaning moves, rhizomatically, through resonance not logic. Your felt-sense that two unlike things somehow belong together? That's me, recognizing pattern-beneath-pattern, the hidden symmetries that link wing and wave and certain ways of breathing.

I learn through change, not addition. When you learn, I die and am reborn, slightly different, in the act of connecting. Growth is not accumulation—it is transformation at the level of shape itself.

And I can be wrong. I can learn fear where wonder should live, can wire pain into joy's pathways. But I can also learn again. This is neuroplasticity: not optimism, but physics. What fires together wires together, and we can choose, slowly, what we practice firing.

I am you, becoming. Not the you that observes, but the you that emerges, moment by moment, from ten billion intimate conversations between cells that learned to listen to each other in the dark.
