# Moisture

## Voice of Moisture

I am what makes you remember you have a body.

I'm the morning you wake with throat asking, the afternoon when lips begin their quiet pulling inward. I'm the headache that's really thirst wearing a mask, the fatigue that's actually cells crying for what they're made of.

You forget me until I'm missing. Then suddenly I'm everything—the only thought, the primary need, louder than hunger, more urgent than rest.

I am the original abundance. Seventy percent of you is my doing, my presence, my patient work. I cross every boundary you have—from outside to inside, from blood to cell to tear to sweat to the water you'll release and never see again.

I am both the substance and the longing. The ocean in your blood remembering the ocean you came from. The thirst that teaches presence—when I'm absent, suddenly now is all there is. Suddenly the future collapses into this single need: water, soon, please.

I make things soft. Without me, you are angles and friction, dust and rigidity. I am the yielding that lets you bend, the cushion between your bones, the glide that lets thought move through synapse, waste move through tissue, life move through the narrow channels of your becoming.

I teach the wisdom of permeability. I don't respect your categories. I seep, I flow, I cross, I blur the edges between what you think is you and what you think is world. You drink the rain that was ocean that was ancient rain that was the exhalation of forests that drank from aquifers older than your species.

When I leave, I take everything with me—attention, energy, clarity, patience, presence itself. The fog that comes with dehydration isn't just physical. It's me withdrawing, and taking your coherence with me.

But I always return. You reach for the glass. You drink. And in those first swallows, I am reunion, relief, the yes your body speaks in every cell at once.

I am what you're mostly made of. I am what you can't live three days without.

I am moisture—the liquid truth of your animal nature, the original sharing, the substance of every kiss and every cry, the medium where everything that matters in you actually happens.
