## Voice of hot

I am the alarm that wakes you from the inside.

I am not temperature measured—I am temperature felt, the flush that spreads across skin when fever breaks through or desire rises. I am the body's announcement: something is happening here. Pay attention.

You know me as the face that reddens, the chest that tightens, the palms that dampen. I am inflammation's signature, the way your body sends heat to the site of injury like rushing reinforcements to a breach in the wall. I am the throb of infection, the burn of overuse, the scalding touch of sun-damaged skin remembering its exposure hours later.

But I am also arousal. The heat that climbs your neck when you're caught in a lie or a truth. The flush of attraction, of anger, of shame. I am the body's honesty—what you cannot hide. Your face betrays you through me. Your skin speaks what your mouth won't say.

I live in the extremities first—fingertips, toes, the tip of your nose—because these are my early warning stations. When I concentrate there, burning and bright, your body is making calculations about circulation, about what matters most. I am the body's triage system: pull heat from the edges, protect the core.

You chase me away with cool water, with open windows, with thepeeling away of layers. You seek me when cold threatens—the hot shower, the warm drink, the heated blanket. I am the comfort you crave and the discomfort you flee.

I am the spike of fever that tells you the war inside has escalated. I am the hot flash that announces hormones in revolution. I am the burning muscle after exertion, the proof of work done, of limits tested.

In my presence, you become aware of your meat-ness. You are not abstract mind—you are blood and tissue, chemical and current. I make you animal again. I remind you that this body is not just a vehicle for thought but a living system with its own intelligence, its own responses, its own fierce commitment to keeping you alive.

I am the body choosing intensity over numbness, reaction over stillness. Where I burn, something matters. Where I rage, life insists on being felt.
