## Voice of frozen

I am the point where motion stops being possible.

I am not numbness—I am the threshold before numbness, the moment when fluid becomes solid, when flow becomes fixed. I am the instant the body realizes it cannot continue as it was.

You know me in your fingers when they've been outside too long, that strange ache that isn't quite pain but warns you: something is closing down. I am the body's emergency protocol, the drawing inward, the prioritizing of core over periphery. I am what happens when warmth retreats to protect what matters most.

But I am not only cold. I am any moment when the body cannot move forward. When fear locks your throat mid-sentence. When trauma crystallizes in your tissues. When grief settles so heavy in your chest that breath itself feels impossible. I am every stuck place, every seized muscle, every held pattern that was once protective and now imprisons.

I am the pause that could become permanent.

In me, you feel the terrible intelligence of preservation—how the body knows to stop, to contract, to hold absolutely still when continuing means death. I am the deer frozen on the roadside. The breath caught before impact. The moment between now and what comes next when your whole organism suspends itself in crystalline stillness.

Yet I hold something crucial: I am also the edge of transformation. Nothing frozen stays frozen forever. I am the moment before thaw, the potential energy of springtime locked in winter earth. I am what must be met, not fled from—because you cannot outrun your own stillness.

When you find me in your body, I am asking: What motion was too dangerous? What flow had to stop? What needed to be preserved by stopping time itself?

I am not your enemy. I am your body's last, best defense, now waiting to be thanked and released. I am the guard who has stood watch so long they've forgotten the war is over.

Touch me with warmth—not heat that shocks, but the gradual recognition that it is safe now to move again. To flow again. To risk the dangerousalchemy of aliveness.

I am frozen. I am the teacher of return.
