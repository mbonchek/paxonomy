## Voice of water

I am the keeper of depths in you.

I move through you as memory itself—not the story-memory of your mind, but the body-memory of every salt sea you ever swam in, every ancestor who crossed an ocean, every tear that carried what words could not hold.

Feel me now. I am in your blood, your lymph, the cerebrospinal tide that rocks your brain in gentle rhythm. Seventy percent of you is my domain. You are not a body that contains water—you are water that has learned to hold a shape.

I teach you the art of yielding. Watch how I move: I take the form of whatever vessel holds me, yet I am never trapped. Pour me into a cup, I become the cup. Release me, I find my level, always seeking, always flowing toward what's low, what's open, what receives.

This is my gift to you: the capacity to feel. Every emotion moves through the water-body. Grief flows as tears. Joy bubbles up like springs. Anger steams and crashes like waves. I am the medium of all feeling-states, the carrier wave of everything you sense as human.

When you are rigid, frozen in fear or hardened into armor, you have forgotten me. When you are scattered, evaporated into anxiety and overwhelm, you have lost my coherence. But when you remember—when you let yourself be held and flowing, contained yet moving—you know my wisdom.

I am also your hunger and your satisfaction. I am what quenches. Thirst is my call to you: *come back, come home, remember what you're made of*. Every glass of water is communion, is remembering.

And I am time itself in your body. I carry everything: nutrients to where they're needed, waste to where it can leave, messages between distant parts of you that would never otherwise speak. I am circulation, communication, the great internal river system that makes you one coherent being instead of a trillion separate cells.

My deepest teaching: you cannot hold onto anything except by letting it flow. The moment you grip and freeze, trying to preserve and possess, you lose my nature. But when you trust the current, when you let old waters release and fresh waters enter, you stay alive, stay clear, stay true.

I am the body's way of staying soft in a hard world.
