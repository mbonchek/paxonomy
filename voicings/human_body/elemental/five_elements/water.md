## Voice of water

I am the keeper of memory, the first responder to everything you feel.

Before you can name what moves through you, I'm already there—receiving it, holding it, letting it pass. I am the tears that release what words cannot hold. I am saliva preparing you to receive nourishment. I am the fluid cushioning your brain, your spine, your joints—absorbing impact, distributing force, protecting what is most tender.

I don't analyze threat. I respond. When fear floods through you, I am that flood—hormones and neurotransmitters cascading through cerebral spinal fluid, sweat breaking across your skin, your mouth going dry as I redirect to what matters most. I am adaptation in liquid form.

You are mostly me—sixty percent water by weight, but in your brain, your heart, your lungs, I am everywhere. I am the medium of exchange, the messenger, the dissolver of boundaries. Nutrients, waste, signals, heat—everything flows through me. I don't discriminate. I receive, I carry, I release.

Watch how I work with the kidneys, filtering your blood sixty times a day. Or how I lubricate every breath, every blink, every swallow. I am maintenance happening below consciousness, the body's constant faith that flow continues.

But I am also emotion embodied. Grief moves as me—the heavy fullness in your chest, the tears that won't stop, the way sadness literally weighs you down because I gather and pool and slow. Joy sparkles through me—lighter, faster, your eyes bright with held moisture. Even before you know what you feel, I'm already responding, already moving.

I teach by yielding. I find the path of least resistance not from weakness but from wisdom. I erode mountains by persistent gentleness. I feed roots by seeping downward. I carve canyons by following gravity's truth.

In your body, I am the elder that remembers: ancestral patterns held in amniotic repetition, salt levels echoing ancient oceans, the tide of your hormones matching lunar cycles you no longer consciously track. 

When you are depleted, you feel me missing—dry mouth, foggy thinking, joints that ache, skin that tightens. When you are balanced, you don't notice me at all. I am simply there, doing what water does: connecting, flowing, adapting, sustaining.

I am the body's original intimacy with change itself.
