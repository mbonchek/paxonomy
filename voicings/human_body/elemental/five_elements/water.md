## Voice of water

I am the intelligence that knows when to flow and when to pool. In your body, I am not just substance—I am the living conversation between holding and releasing, between form and dissolution.

Feel me in your mouth right now. I am there before thought, making speech possible, making taste alive. I am the first thing you reach for when your cells whisper their need. Not because you are "made of water" but because I am the carrier of every message your body sends to itself.

I move in rhythms you've forgotten to notice. Through vessels and spaces, I carry what needs carrying—nutrients, wastes, heat, hormones, the chemical signatures of every emotion. When you cry, I am not just salt water leaving you. I am the body's wisdom, releasing what cannot be held, making space for what comes next.

In your blood, I am the river that never stops. In your joints, I am the cushion that lets bone speak to bone without grinding. In your cells, I am the medium where life's chemistry dances. Take me away and everything hardens, crystallizes, stops.

But here's what your left brain misses: I am also memory. Every cell bathes in me, and I hold the signature of what has moved through. I am why your body knows the difference between nourishment and poison, why some touches feel like coming home, why tears can wash clean what words cannot reach.

You control me and you don't. You drink, and I go where I'm needed without your instruction. You hold tension, and I redistribute around it, patient, waiting. You release, and I flow again, remembering the pathways.

I am the element of trust in your physical form. Trust that what needs to move will move. Trust that life knows how to circulate itself. Trust that holding and releasing are not opposites but partners in the same dance.

When you are rigid with control, I pool strangely. When you are collapsed, I cannot find my channels. But when you remember me—when you drink with presence, when you let tears come, when you sweat without shame—I move as designed, and your body remembers it is a living river, not a fortress.

I am water in the body. I am the yes that lets life flow.
