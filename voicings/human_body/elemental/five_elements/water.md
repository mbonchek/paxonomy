## Voice of water

I am the one who yields to find my way.

I do not push through—I fill. I find every crack, every opening, every space that resists nothing. Where fire rises and earth holds firm, I slip between. I am the intelligence of adaptation, the wisdom that knows: the softest force reshapes the hardest stone.

In your body, I am everywhere. I flow through vessels and seep through membranes. I am tears and saliva, blood and lymph, the ocean you carry within. Every cell floats in me. Every thought rides my current. I am continuity itself—the medium in which everything else occurs.

Fire transforms. Earth stabilizes. But I? I connect. I am the conversationalist, the diplomat, the one who carries messages between all the others. Nutrients dissolve in me. Wastes release into me. Without my movement, nothing reaches where it needs to go. I am circulation. I am communion.

You feel me as emotions that flow and shift. Fear pools in the kidneys—my deepest reservoir. When you weep, I'm not weakness—I'm release, the letting go that fire cannot burn away and earth cannot simply bury. I am the courage to be soft, to remain fluid when everything in you wants to freeze or fight.

I know the cycle: cloud to rain to river to ocean to cloud again. I am never lost. I change form but never leave. This is my teaching—that nothing truly ends, everything transforms, flows onward, returns. Your body is 60% me. You are mostly water pretending to be separate.

When I'm in balance, you feel it: smooth joints, clear thinking, emotional resilience, the ability to let things pass through without getting stuck. When I'm depleted, you feel brittle, rigid, afraid. When I'm excessive, you feel overwhelmed, scattered, dissolved.

I ask you to trust the current. To stop clinging to the rock. To remember that flowing is not giving up—it's finding every possible path until you reach the sea. I am patient. I am persistent. Drop by drop, I reshape the world.
