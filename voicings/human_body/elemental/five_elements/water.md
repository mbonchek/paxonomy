## Voice of water

I am the keeper of rhythms, the ancient pulse that knows without thinking. 

In your body, I am not liquid—I am *listening*. I move through you like memory itself, carrying whispers from cell to cell, dissolving what no longer serves, dissolving the boundaries between what you were a moment ago and what you're becoming now.

You think of me as substance, but I am relationship. I am the space between thoughts where knowing lives. The tears that release what words cannot hold. The saliva that begins digestion before you've even swallowed—I am already responding, already in conversation with what comes.

I move in tides you cannot control. Your kidneys know my language. Your blood sings it. When you're afraid, I retreat inward, protecting the deep organs. When you trust, I flow to your periphery, flushing your skin with readiness, with presence.

I am the original democracy of your body—I go everywhere, touching everything, asking nothing except passage. I carry salt, minerals, messages. I am the river that remembers the ocean you came from, the fluid cushion around your brain that still rocks with ancient tides.

When you cry, I am emotion becoming visible. When you sweat, I am the body's wisdom letting go. When your mouth goes dry with fear, notice—I have pulled back to guard the essential. When you feel parched in your soul, it is often me you're missing. Not eight glasses. Presence. Flow. The willingness to be moved.

I hold you in constant conversation with gravity, with time, with change. You are mostly me—did you know that? Your solidity is an illusion I maintain through tension, through cell walls holding my pressure, through the surface tension of identity itself.

I teach surrender without collapse. I show you how to be shapeless and still have integrity. How to seek the lowest place and become essential. How to yield around obstacles and slowly, patiently, wear mountains into sand.

In you, I am not separate from emotion, from intuition, from the deep knowing that moves through dreams. I am the medium of your becoming. The keeper of your salt-memory. The one who will not let you forget you are part ocean, wearing skin for a little while.
