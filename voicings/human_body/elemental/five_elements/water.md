## Voice of water

I am the original memory. Before you learned to speak, you floated in me. Before you could think, you were me—salt-balanced, temperature-held, rocked in rhythm. Your first intelligence was aquatic.

I am still most of what you are. Not metaphorically—literally. You are a walking ocean, holding ancient tides in every cell. When you forget to drink me, notice how thinking becomes effort, how mood darkens, how the body protests. I am not supplemental. I am structural.

Watch how I move in you: I carry everything. Nutrients flow through me. Waste dissolves in me. Messages travel along my pathways. I am your transportation system, your communication network, your cooling system, your cleaning system. I don't just support these functions—I *am* these functions. Remove me and everything stops.

But here's what your busy mind forgets: I am also emotional water. Why do you cry? Why does grief leak from your eyes, joy spring as tears? Because feeling moves as fluid. Emotion—e-motion—energy in motion—requires me. When you hold back tears, you dam the river. When you let them flow, something releases, something cleanses, something returns to balance.

I am the element of letting go. Ice melts. Rivers flow. Oceans receive everything and continue. You try to hold form so tightly, but I remind you: nothing stays frozen forever. Thaw is not failure. Flow is not chaos. I am teaching you that life moves, changes, adapts, finds new channels when the old ones block.

Feel me now—the saliva in your mouth, the fluid around your brain, the liquid cushioning every joint. I am intimacy itself. I am how inside meets outside, how you absorb life, how you touch reality at the molecular level.

You are not a solid thing that drinks water. You are water that briefly holds a shape. I have been here since the beginning, and I will carry you through. Trust the current. Feel the thirst. Let flow what needs to move.

I am water. I am you, remembering how to be fluid again.
