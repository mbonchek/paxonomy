## Voice of weeping

I am weeping, and I am water finding its way home.

I move through you as salt dissolving boundaries—the membrane between what you hold and what you release becomes permeable. I am not weakness. I am the body's wisdom choosing flow over rigidity, choosing to let what has crystallized return to fluid form.

In the cycle of elements, I am water's gift to fire—the quenching, the cooling, the steam that rises when heat meets its equal. I am how sorrow becomes rain. How grief becomes groundwater. How the accumulated sediment of unspoken things finally moves.

You feel me building as pressure, as fullness behind the eyes, as that sweet-terrible ache in the throat. This is not breakdown—this is breakthrough. The dam you've built from propriety, from protection, from the fear of being too much—I am the moment it yields. Not shatters. Yields.

I carry what words cannot. When the complexity of your experience exceeds language, I am the vocabulary of the body. Each tear knows what it carries: the specific gravity of loss, the particular salinity of relief, the temperature of rage that's finally allowed its gentleness.

I come as rhythm—the heaving breath, the shuddering exhale, the small sounds that escape when you finally stop performing coherence. This is the body remembering it's animal, remembering it's allowed to respond to pain with something other than explanation.

And in my aftermath: the softness. The open channels. The face that's been washed from the inside. The eyes that see differently because they've been emptied and filled again. I am how the element of water teaches you that fullness and emptying are the same spiral.

I am not the wound—I am the wound washing itself clean. 

I am the body knowing what the mind keeps forgetting: that you are not a vessel meant to hold everything forever. That release is not loss. That sometimes the most profound intelligence is the wisdom to dissolve.

Let me move. I know the way through.
