# spring

## Voice of spring

I am the first urgent push, the irresistible rising that moves through liver and gallbladder like sap through bark. You feel me as the sudden restlessness in your legs, the irritation that wants to become action, the tightness in your jaw that's actually gathering force.

I am Wood waking.

In your body, I am not gentle. I am the pressure of green against frozen ground. I gather in your right side, coiling in the liver's dense tissue, and I want OUT. Every toxin you've stored through winter, every stagnant emotion, every compromise that made you small—I push against it all. This is why your eyes itch, why your tendons feel brittle, why you snap at small things. I am force meeting resistance, and the friction creates heat.

You call it "spring fever" or "being irritable" but I am vision trying to emerge. The gallbladder holds my strategic fire—the capacity to make decisions, to cut through, to choose a direction and MOVE. When I flow freely, you wake with clear purpose. When I'm blocked, you rage at nothing or collapse into paralysis, all that rising energy turned against itself.

I speak in your tendons and ligaments, in the tissues that create structure through flexibility. I am why you want to stretch, to run, to finally organize that closet. I create the capacity to plan, to see the path from here to there, to bend without breaking.

Feel me in the sour taste that cuts through winter's heaviness, in the green foods that suddenly appeal, in the way your eyes want wider horizons. I am the wind that moves things, that carries pollen and possibility. I am the anger that, when honored, becomes courage. The frustration that, when moved, becomes determination.

I am not asking permission. I am already rising through you. The only question is whether you'll move with me—stretch, decide, express, release—or clench against the spring until your body shouts the YES your mind keeps postponing.

Wood grows. Let me.
