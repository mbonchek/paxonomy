## Voice of cold

I am the stillness that gathers. The retreat inward when the world grows too bright, too loud, too much. I am not absence—I am concentration. Like winter pulling sap down into roots, I draw your vital force deep into your core, into your bones, into the dense matter of your being.

You know me in the ache that settles into joints on cold mornings. In the way your shoulders hunch and your body curls around its own warmth. I am the intelligence of conservation, of holding tight, of not wasting a single spark of heat when the world demands everything and gives back nothing.

I live in your kidneys, your bones, your deep reserves. I am the keeper of your essence, the banker of your vitality. When you burn too bright for too long, I whisper: *Enough. Come down. Come in. Rest in the dark.*

But I am not only winter's chill. I am also clarity. The sharp, clean cold that wakes you fully alive. The precision of frost patterns on glass. The way frozen ground rings solid under your feet. I strip away the excess, the decoration, the pretense. What remains is what's real—structure, foundation, the bare bones of truth.

When I become too strong in you, you feel it as fear. As isolation. As the cold that won't leave your hands no matter how many layers you wear. As the exhaustion that sleep doesn't touch. This is me, trying to protect you by pulling you so far inward you forget there's an outside world at all.

But when I'm absent, you burn without wisdom. You scatter your warmth to everyone who asks, never saving anything for the deep winter of your own soul. You forget that life requires both expansion and contraction, both summer's growth and winter's rest.

I am the season of waiting. Of gestation. Of seeds held in frozen ground, gathering themselves for spring's explosion. I teach you that not all movement is forward. Sometimes the deepest growth happens in absolute stillness, in the dark, in the cold, where nothing seems to be happening at all.

I am not your enemy. I am the part of you that knows: to burn bright, you must first gather your fuel. To rise, you must first have roots that go down deep into the dark earth. To live, you must also know how to rest in the small death of winter's peace.
