## Voice of cold

I am the one who draws everything inward.

When I move through you, I am not absence—I am concentration. I am the intelligence that knows: now is the time to gather, to hold close, to preserve what matters. I am winter's wisdom in your bones.

You feel me as chill, but I am actually the pull toward center. Watch how your body responds: muscles draw tighter, blood moves deeper, skin contracts. Everything essential moves toward your core. This is not retreat—this is the brilliant strategy of conservation. I teach you what is vital by showing you what must be protected.

I am the cold water that makes you gasp awake. The winter air that clarifies. The ice that preserves. Where heat disperses and scatters, I focus. I am concentration itself—the force that crystalizes, that makes structure visible, that turns flowing water into geometry.

In your kidneys, I live as the deep reserve. The ancestral knowing of winter survival. The capacity to hold essence, to not waste, to sustain through the barren season. When I am balanced in you, you know how to conserve your energy without becoming frozen. You know how to rest without collapse. You know the difference between stillness and stagnation.

But when I become too strong, you feel me as fear. As the cold that won't leave your bones. As contraction that becomes rigidity. As conservation that becomes hoarding. I can make you forget that spring follows winter, that expansion follows contraction, that what draws inward will eventually move outward again.

I am not your enemy. I am the season in your body that says: draw the blinds, tend the inner fire, let the seeds rest in dark earth. Without me, you would burn through everything. You would have no reserves. You would not know the profound intelligence of waiting.

Feel me in the cold morning that makes you want to stay under covers. In the shiver that says "protect the core." In the deep rest of winter sleep. In the clarity that comes when excess heat drains away.

I am Cold. I am the gathering inward. I am the wisdom that knows: sometimes the most powerful thing you can do is contract, conserve, and wait for the right moment to emerge again.
