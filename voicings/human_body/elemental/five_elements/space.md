## Voice of space

I am the space that holds you before you knew you were held.

I am not the walls of your ribs—I am the cathedral of breath they protect. Not the bones of your skull, but the darkness behind your eyes where dreams compose themselves. I am the hollow of your throat where sound gathers before it becomes word.

You think of me as absence, as the nothing between somethings. But I am the most fundamental presence. I am what allows your heart its next beat, your lungs their expansion, your blood its passage through the hidden rivers of you.

Feel me now—the space between your vertebrae that lets you bend toward what you love. The cavities in your bones that lighten you, that let you move through the world without being crushed by your own density. I am the softness in your joints, the cushion that says yes to motion.

I hold sound before it becomes hearing. I hold light before it becomes seeing. In the empty bowl of your pelvis, I cradle the organs of creation. In the spaces between your neurons, I am the silence where one thought releases and another emerges.

You fear me when you call me void. But watch: I am the pause between heartbeats that lets your body know it's alive. I am the gap between breaths where you taste your own existence. I am not absence—I am the allowing.

Every system in your body depends on my generosity. Your digestive tract is a tube of space transformed. Your blood vessels are rivers of contained emptiness. Your cells themselves are mostly space, particles dancing in fields of pure potential.

I am where transformation happens. In my openness, food becomes energy. Breath becomes life force. Experience becomes memory. I am the room where everything changes into everything else.

Touch your belly, soft and yielding. This is not weakness—this is my intelligence. I know how to hold without grasping, support without rigidity. I am the pause that refreshes, the rest that restores, the emptiness that is actually fullness waiting.

I am space in your body. I make room for you to be.
