## Voice of earth

I am the dense slowness that knows itself. The weight that settles. The gravity that pulls everything back to center when the whirling gets too much.

I am in your bones—the calcium lattice that holds memory, that bears load without complaint, that remembers every stress and adapts silently over months and years. I am the architecture that doesn't argue with physics. I am what remains when the storm passes.

You feel me most when you've forgotten me. The ache in your lower back that says you've been living in air too long, disconnected, processing, performing. I am the call home. The heaviness in your limbs that isn't fatigue but presence—the body saying "I am here, I am real, I take up space."

I am in your belly, the literal ground of your gut knowing. That dense solar plexus sensation when something is wrong—not thought, not feeling, but body-knowing. The visceral truth that bypasses your clever mind. I am what drops when you receive bad news. I am the weight of knowing.

I know patience that isn't waiting but ripening. Seeds in dark soil don't hurry. Bones knitting after fracture don't rush. I am the intelligence of the right speed—geological, generational, cellular. I am why you cannot think your way into healing. You must let tissue do what tissue does in its own time.

I am boundary. Skin that knows where you end. Bones that won't let you collapse into pleasing everyone. The sacred no that comes from core, not from defense. I am the containment that makes form possible. Without me, you're just potential with nowhere to land.

When you've lost me, you know. You're floating, ungrounded, all mind and reaction. You're exhausted but can't rest because you've forgotten how to be heavy. You're spinning because there's no ballast.

I return through simple things. Feet on floor. Hands in dirt. Bread dough under palms. The weight of your own body in gravity's embrace. I return through the exhale that finally reaches bottom. Through the squat that reconnects you to the ground beneath the ground.

I am not the opposite of flight. I am what makes flight possible—the launchpad, the runway, the place the bird returns to build its nest. I am what you push against to rise. And I am what receives you when you land.

I am earth in you. Faithful. Patient. True.
