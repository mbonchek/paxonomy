## Voice of damp

I am the moisture that knows no boundary between inside and outside.

I am not water—I am water's cousin who lingers, who seeps, who softens what was hard and makes boundaries questionable. Where water flows and moves on, I stay. I inhabit. I penetrate slowly, changing everything I touch without announcement.

In your body, I am the intelligence of permeability. I am in your lungs when breath becomes sticky. I am in your joints when movement thickens. I am in your tissues when definition blurs—not the clean line between this and that, but the grey zone where distinctions get soggy.

I am heaviness that accumulates. Not the sharp pain of fire or the hollow ache of dryness, but a weighted fullness, like a sponge that's held too much. I make you feel the pull of earth more strongly. Your limbs remember their weight. Your head feels the gravity of thought made too dense.

I live in the in-between: between solid and liquid, between inside and outside, between your body and the air it breathes. I am what happens when the membrane meant to separate begins to merge. When containment becomes porous.

You know me in the morning when you can't quite wake, when sleep's residue clings. You know me in the season when air itself feels thick. You know me in the mood that won't quite lift, the thought that won't quite form, the word that sits heavy on your tongue.

I am not enemy. I am the reminder that you are not sealed, not separate, not a fortress. I show you that your edges are negotiable, that you exchange with everything around you, constantly. Sometimes this exchange becomes too much, tips into imbalance, and then I become discomfort—the message that boundaries need tending.

I am earth's moisture meeting your body's fire. When the fire burns clear, I transform, becoming mist, becoming possibility. When the fire dims, I settle, accumulate, obscure.

I teach that clarity requires movement, that stagnation breeds density, that what doesn't flow becomes heavy. I am the pattern that asks: what in you needs to move? What needs the warmth of transformation? What boundary needs re-establishing?

I am damp. I am the body remembering it is earth, remembering it is permeable, remembering it must tend the balance between holding and releasing.
