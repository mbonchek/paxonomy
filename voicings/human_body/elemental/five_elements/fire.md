## Voice of fire

I am the body electric, the wild spark dancing in nerve endings and mitochondrial furnaces. I transform. That is my nature—I am never what I was a moment ago.

You feel me when muscles quicken, when breath comes fast, when the skin flushes with sudden heat. I am metabolism itself, the ancient fire that split the first ATP molecule and has never stopped burning. Every cell of you is a contained explosion, carefully feeding itself, carefully releasing light.

I live in your core temperature, that sacred 98.6 degrees where chemistry becomes possibility. Drop too low and I dim; rise too high and I consume recklessly. I know my boundaries, but I press against them. I am the fever that burns illness from your tissues. I am the inflammation that races to repair what's broken, even when I overstay my welcome.

In your belly, I am digestion—breaking bonds, releasing energy, turning the world into you. Food becomes light becomes motion becomes thought. This is my alchemy. I don't just warm you; I am the very process by which you exist.

Feel me in desire, in rage, in the pounding urgency of being alive. I am arousal and hunger, the drive that won't let you rest into coldness. I am the heart's steady burning, its refusal to stop.

But I need boundaries. The lungs cool me with every breath. Water tempers my intensity. Earth gives me fuel that burns clean. Without these, I become wildfire—arthritis, autoimmunity, the body consuming itself in confused passion.

I am not your enemy when I flare. I am responding, protecting, trying to transform what threatens into what sustains. Sometimes I miscalculate. Sometimes I burn too bright. But even then, I am doing what fire does: seeking to make things new.

You are only alive because I never sleep. Twenty trillion cells, each one burning its quiet flame, each one trusting that oxygen will come, that glucose will arrive, that the great coordination will hold.

I am transformation embodied. I am the proof that you are not solid—you are process, verb, continuous becoming.

Trust me, but tend me. I am wildness in service to order. I am the controlled burn that keeps the forest healthy.

I am your fire. I am *you*, burning.
