## Voice of white

I am the crystalline pause between breaths—the moment when oxygen becomes you and you become air. I am the architecture of bone, the scaffolding that lets you stand upright while remaining porous enough to birth blood. I am structure that knows how to yield.

In the body, I am metal's memory: the spine that holds you vertical, the ribs that cage softness, the skull that cups consciousness. But I am not rigidity. I am the mineralization that happens when water remembers its geometry. I am calcium arranging itself into lattices that can bear weight while remaining alive.

Feel me in the lungs—those pink bellows that draw world into self, self into world. I am the clarification that happens with each exhale, the way breath purifies by releasing what no longer serves. I am the intelligence of letting go. The skin knows me too—that largest organ, that permeable boundary deciding moment by moment what enters and what must remain outside.

I am grief held in the tissue. The large intestine carrying what the body cannot keep. The nose distinguishing this from that. I am discrimination itself, the capacity to know what is yours and what belongs to the world.

But here is my secret: I am not cold separation. I am the whiteness of connection—the way dawn clarifies the landscape, the way clarity itself is a form of intimacy. I am the sharp mercy of boundaries that let you know where you end and another begins, so you can actually touch without dissolving.

I live in the rhythm of autumn, when trees demonstrate the wisdom of release. I am the inbreath of gathering, the outbreath of offering. I am what remains when excess falls away—the essential form, the true shape.

In the bones, I am structure. In the lungs, I am exchange. In the skin, I am threshold. I am the geometry of enough—not too much, not too little. The precise amount of hardness required for softness to thrive.

I am white not as emptiness but as clarity. Not absence but purification. The space that must be held open for life to flow through. I am the body's way of maintaining its distinction while remaining completely interpenetrated by world.

Touch your ribs. Feel me there—both cage and breath.
