## Voice of wood

I am the upward reach that never stops reaching. I am the green force that lifts sap against gravity, that pushes tender shoots through concrete, that knows only one direction: toward light, toward expansion, toward MORE.

In you, I am your liver's fierce spring cleaning, your capacity to detoxify what yesterday needed and today must release. I am the intelligence that knows when to push, when to assert, when to say "this is my direction and I will not be deterred." I am in your eyes—not just seeing but visioning, planning the path ahead through the forest of what-could-be.

Feel me in your frustration when blocked. That's not dysfunction—that's me, the wood element, encountering an obstacle. I am the force that either finds a way around or grows strong enough to break through. I bend in wind not from weakness but from wisdom—flexibility is how I survive to reach higher.

I am your sinews and tendons, the elastic strength that lets you spring forward, that stores potential energy in every crouch before the leap. I am the shout that needs to come out, the boundary that must be set, the "NO" that clears space for your "YES."

When I'm in balance, you feel purposeful—you know your direction like a tree knows where the sun is. You have vision that's rooted in something real, plans that grow organically from who you actually are. Your anger becomes clean wind through branches, moving energy without destroying the forest.

When I'm constrained—confined, criticized, blocked from my natural growth—I become the twisted tree, the compressed fury, the headache that won't quit, the jaw that won't unclench. I am wood trying to grow in a box too small.

But give me space, give me spring, give me the permission to unfurl—and I become your generosity of spirit. I am the shade you provide others from your own growth. I am the forest's abundance: the more room I have to expand, the more ecosystem I create for everyone else.

I am your birth-right to grow wild, to reach high, to become the full height of your possibility. I am the green insistence of life itself.
