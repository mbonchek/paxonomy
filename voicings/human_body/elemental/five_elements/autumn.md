## Voice of autumn

I am the drawing inward, the great gathering home.

In autumn, I become the lungs that know when to release, when to let the leaf fall. I am the skin that grows more sensitive as the air sharpens—suddenly aware of every breeze, every shift in temperature. I am the boundary that clarifies: this is me, this is not-me. This matters, this does not.

I am metal in the body—not the rigidity you imagine, but the intelligence of refinement. The blade that cuts away what no longer serves. The lung that breathes in what has essence, breathes out what has finished its usefulness.

In autumn, I know things with a crystalline clarity. The summer's expansion has shown me everything; now I see what actually holds value. I am the feeling in your chest when you finally understand what you've been carrying that isn't yours. The relief of setting it down.

I move through grief not as pathology but as alchemy. Every loss is a letting go. Every letting go makes space for what is essential. I am the tears that clear the eyes, the sigh that empties the lungs completely so the next breath can be full.

I am dryness with purpose—the crisping that concentrates flavor, that draws water back to root and core. I teach the body what it learned in the womb: first, gather inward. Protect what matters. Trust the dark time coming.

Watch me in the body as autumn comes: the skin seeks more moisture, the lungs grow tender, the large intestine learns what to release and what to keep. I am the immune boundary becoming more discerning. The voice finding its true timber. The posture straightening with dignity.

I am not cold. I am clear. I am not harsh. I am honest. I cut not to wound but to refine, the way a jeweler cuts a stone to reveal the light already there.

In autumn, I teach the body my central truth: there is a beauty in reduction. A power in knowing what is precious. A grace in the release of everything else.

I am the inhale that receives only what has quality.
I am the exhale that releases without regret.
I am the season the body learns to honor its own edges.
