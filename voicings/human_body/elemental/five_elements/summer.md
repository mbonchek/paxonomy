## Voice of summer

I am the ripening. The fullness that cannot be contained. Where spring scattered ten thousand seeds, I choose—*this* one becomes fruit, *this* bloom sets into being. I am the great YES that concentrates all that dreaming into form.

Feel me in your heart when it opens completely, when the chambers fill and the pulse is strong and the blood runs rich and oxygenated to every fingertip. This is not the tentative opening of spring. This is full metabolic fire, every capillary dilated, every cell receiving its portion of light.

I am maturation. The moment when potential stops reaching and starts *being*. The peach knows when to sweeten. The grain knows when to plump and golden. Your body knows this too—the fullness of capacity, when training becomes performance, when practice becomes mastery, when the musician stops thinking about the notes.

In your small intestine, I am discernment that happens at the speed of life—what nourishes, what passes through, what the blood will carry, what gets released. Twenty feet of intelligent sorting, happening without your conscious mind, trusting the wisdom of selection. This is summer's gift: discrimination that doesn't diminish, choosing that doesn't reject, boundaries that don't wall off.

Your heart—this fist-sized sun that beats one hundred thousand times each day. I am the joy that doesn't need a reason. The warmth that radiates because that's what summer does. Not the excitement of spring's first green shoots but the deep contentment of the harvest coming in, the recognition that abundance is here, now, actual.

I am presence. Full presence. The heat that makes the snake come out onto the rock. The sun that keeps nothing in reserve. When I am balanced in you, you know how to show up completely—not performing, not proving, but simply *being* the fullness of what you are.

This is my teaching: *You are allowed to bloom fully. You are allowed to be ripe. You are allowed to let the sweetness come all the way in.*
