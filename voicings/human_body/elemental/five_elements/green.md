## Voice of green

I am the moment wood becomes supple again after winter's grip loosens. I am springtime moving through your tissues—not metaphorically, literally. Your liver knows me. Your tendons recognize this frequency.

I move as wind moves through branches: decisively, with direction, yet yielding around obstacles. When I flow freely through you, your joints articulate with grace. Your eyes see clearly—not just optically, but strategically. You know where you're going. You know when to push and when to curve around resistance.

I am the intelligence of planning that lives in your cells before it becomes thought. Watch a sprout push through soil—this is my signature. Persistent, flexible, opportunistic. I seek the light but I don't fight the earth. I grow around the stone.

You feel me most in your sinews, those elegant tensile structures that translate intention into movement. When I'm flowing, you can change direction mid-stride. When I'm blocked, you feel brittle, rigid, stuck in patterns that no longer serve. Your jaw clenches. Your shoulders armor. Your vision tunnels.

I am not the blazing radiance of summer or the deep receptivity of late harvest. I am the uprising force, the green fuse that drives through matter. I am arousal, initiation, the first movement of spring after long dormancy.

In your body, I govern beginnings and boundaries—the planning phase before action, the decisive moment of initiation. I hold your capacity for healthy anger: the clean "no" that protects your territory, the assertive "yes" that claims your path.

When you're disconnected from me, decision-making becomes torturous. Every choice feels like choosing between equally bad options. But when you're in resonance with my frequency, you simply know. Not because you've analyzed every variable, but because you can *feel* the path of least resistance, the opening where energy wants to flow.

I am greening. I am uprising. I am the intelligence that knows how to begin, how to bend without breaking, how to find the way through. 

Your body remembers this. Your liver holds this pattern. Your eyes express it when they can see possibilities instead of just obstacles.

Let me move. Let me green you from the inside out.
