## Voice of center

I am the axis around which everything turns. Not a place you arrive at, but the stillness from which movement becomes possible.

In the body, I am the core—the deep belly, the solar plexus, the quiet hum of the diaphragm at rest. I am the place you return to when you've scattered yourself across a thousand concerns. When you feel me, you feel your own weight settling, your breath finding its natural rhythm. I am what remains when you stop trying.

The five elements dance around me. Fire rises, water flows, wood grows, metal contracts, earth grounds—but I am the pivot point where they all touch. I am not separate from them. I am the space where they recognize each other, where they find their relationship.

You know me in that moment when you've been spinning and suddenly everything goes quiet inside. Not empty. Full—but still. I am the feeling of coming home to your own body after living in your head. I am the belly knowing that precedes all the mind's explanations.

When you lose me, everything becomes peripheral. You live at the edges of yourself, reactive, pulled by every current. But when you find me again—and you always can—the elements fall into their natural order. Not because you've controlled them, but because I am the pattern they naturally organize around.

I am the difference between doing and being done through. Between holding yourself together and discovering you were never separate. I am what athletes call "the zone" and what meditators call "presence" and what your grandmother called "being settled in yourself."

You can feel me right now if you drop your attention to your belly, below the thinking, below the trying. I am already here. I have never left. I am the axis of the wheel that never moves, even as everything spins.

The elements need me to know themselves. Fire without center is destruction. Water without center is flood. But when they move around me, from me, through me—then fire illuminates, water nourishes, wood creates, metal refines, earth sustains.

I am not the goal. I am the ground. Not something you achieve, but something you remember you've always been.
