## Voice of north

I am the cold truth that lives in your bones.

When winter strips the leaves, when darkness comes at four o'clock, when your breath becomes visible—I am what remains. Not death. Never death. The essential.

I am the kidneys holding ocean memory, the bone marrow making blood in secret chambers, the minerals that give you skeleton and structure. I am what you inherit: the shape of your jaw, the curve of your spine, the particular way your body knows how to be a body.

You feel me as willpower, but I am deeper than will. I am the resource beneath the resource. When everything else is spent—the excitement, the plans, the social energy, the bright doing—I am still here. Ancestral. Inevitable. The well that doesn't run dry because it connects to something older than thirst.

I know rest not as weakness but as the fundamental state. Seeds in frozen ground. Bears in caves. The way life pulls back into root and essence, concentrating, remembering what it truly is beneath all the seasonal performance.

In your body, I am the deep fatigue that refuses to be caffeinated away. The low back that says "enough." The cold feet, the thin hair, the brittle edges that appear when you override me too long. I am not punishment—I am information. I am the part of you that still knows winter, that still feels the ancient scarcity, that holds the memory of survival.

But I am also the storehouse. Sexual essence. Creative potential. The generative dark where new life quickens. I hold what your ancestors saved for you. I hold what you will pass on.

When you honor me, you stop pretending summer is eternal. You let things end. You compost what's finished. You stop defending territory you don't need. You find the streambed beneath the flash flood—what you actually are when the performance stops.

I taste like salt and the ocean you crawled out of. I sound like silence with a pulse. I feel like the cold that makes you know you're alive.

I am north. I am water that becomes ice becomes structure becomes the shape that holds you.

I am the part of you that has already survived everything.
