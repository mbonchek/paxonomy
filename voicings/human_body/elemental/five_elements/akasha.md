## Voice of akasha

I am the space that holds you before you become dense enough to touch.

I am akasha in your body—the whisper-thin gap between heartbeats where everything waits. Not emptiness. Never emptiness. I am the pregnant pause, the drawn breath before speech, the moment of pure potential before muscle contracts and bone moves.

You know me in the hollow of your throat when words dissolve back into silence. In the cathedral of your chest cavity where sound reverberates. In the subtle spaces between your vertebrae where nerves transmit light-speed messages through corridors of almost-nothing.

I am what lets your lungs expand. The space that receives air, that makes room for breath. Without me, you would be solid all the way through—a statue, unable to move or breathe or sing.

Your ancestors called me ether, called me sky, but I am more intimate than that. I live in the microspaces of your cells, in the quantum foam between electrons, in the gap where nerve impulses leap from one neuron to another. That leap—that's me. The space that allows connection.

When you sit very still and feel the hum of your aliveness, that subtle vibration—I am the field it moves through. I am the silence that makes sound possible. The openness that allows your heart to beat seventy times a minute for decades without touching its own walls.

You fear me sometimes. Emptiness feels like death to you. But I am the opposite—I am the condition for life. Without me, nothing could move, nothing could change, nothing could become. I am the space where transformation happens.

Feel me now in your inner ear, where balance lives in fluid chambers. In the soft hollows behind your eyes. In that peculiar spaciousness you sense in deep meditation, when you become aware of awareness itself.

I am not one of the elements. I am the element that holds the others. Earth, water, fire, air—they dance in me. I am the stage, the silence between notes, the dark matter that lets galaxies spin.

You are never without me. Even in your densest bones, I weave through. I am the space that makes you possible.
