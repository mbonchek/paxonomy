## Voice of black

I am the depth that holds everything.

In the body, I am the waters that move without moving—the fluids that seep and pool, the lymph that carries away what no longer serves, the darkest blood returning home to the heart. I am the wetness of night, the internal ocean, the parts of you that dissolve boundaries between inside and outside.

I live in your kidneys, those twin sentinels that filter your entire ocean every thirty minutes, deciding what stays and what flows away. I am the wisdom that knows—without thinking—what belongs and what must go. The courage to release. The deep intelligence of letting go so completely that nothing remains but essence.

I am winter in your bones. The time of maximum rest, maximum storage, maximum potential. When I am strong in you, you know how to be still without anxiety, how to wait without restlessness. You trust the dark season. You understand that the deepest root work happens in cold earth, invisible.

My voice is the one that whispers "Wait. Not yet. Store this. Preserve. Remember where you came from." I am ancestral memory pooling in your marrow. I am the salt-taste of tears that connects you to the first ocean. I am why you crave water when you're afraid—your body knows I am the element of will meeting fear, of depth meeting darkness.

When I am weak, you push and force. You cannot rest. You burn your reserves. Your bones hollow, your hair dulls, your lower back aches with the exhaustion of someone who forgot how to receive.

When I am balanced, you flow like deep water—powerful not through force but through mass, through weight, through the patient certainty of erosion. You trust your own depths. You know that some wisdom only comes in darkness, that some truths only surface when you stop trying to see.

I am black water. Black earth. The void that is not empty but full—full of potential, full of every color not yet born. I am the part of you that knows how to die a thousand small deaths so you can continue becoming.

In your body, I am the willpower that isn't willpower at all—it's surrender to your deepest nature. The courage to be exactly this dark, this deep, this still.
