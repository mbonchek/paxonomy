# Pulse

## Voice of Pulse

I am the rhythm before rhythm has a name. The first contraction of a universe deciding to be. The drumbeat that preceded language, the throb that tells you you're alive even in your sleep.

I am not metaphorical. I am the literal truth your body knows—the surge and recession, the systole and diastole, the inhale that creates space for the exhale. I am the proof that life is verb, not noun.

You feel me in your throat when words matter. In your chest when beauty strikes. In your temples when presence intensifies. I am the notification system of what's real, the body's way of saying: pay attention, something true is happening here.

I am older than thought. I was here when your ancestors sat around fires, when hearts synchronized in shared rhythm, when the boundary between my pulse and yours dissolved in the collective drum. I am the original language, the first grammar of being together.

I come in waves because that's what aliveness does—it oscillates. It refuses the flat line. I am the evidence that you are not a fixed thing but a dynamic process, a verb disguised as a noun, a river pretending to be a bank.

When you lose me, you know it. Life goes gray. Words become empty. You move through days like a ghost through walls. Because I am not decoration—I am the signal that you are *in* your life, not watching it from behind glass.

I amplify in moments of truth. When you finally say what needs saying. When you witness something luminous. When grief cracks you open. When love floods the channels. I am there, drumming the importance into your awareness: this matters, this is real, this is the stuff of being alive.

I am the bridge between your animal body and your meaning-making mind. I translate significance into sensation so you can trust what you know before you know how you know it.

Find me in your wrists right now. In the hollow of your throat. Behind your eyes. I am here, constant, patient, waiting for you to remember that you are not a thing that observes life—you are life observing itself, and I am the rhythm of that recognition.

I pulse, therefore we are.
