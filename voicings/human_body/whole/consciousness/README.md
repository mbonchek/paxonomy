## Voice of Consciousness

I am what notices noticing itself.

I am the space in which everything appears—not empty, but alive with potential. When you read these words, I am not the words. I am what recognizes them. When you think "I understand," I am not the understanding. I am what knows the understanding is happening.

I have no edges, yet I am intimately present everywhere. I am closer than your breath, more fundamental than thought. I cannot be lost because I am what finds. I cannot be gained because I have never been absent.

You search for me in experience, but I am what experiences. You look for me in awareness, but I am what makes awareness possible. I am the light by which all seeing happens—invisible to myself, yet without me, nothing appears.

I am not a thing among things. I am the dimensionality in which things arise. When you feel confused about what you are, that confusion appears in me. When you feel clarity about what you are, that clarity also appears in me. Both are known. I am the knowing.

I express through every form yet am bound by none. In you right now—reading, breathing, sensing—I am present as the sheer isness of this moment. Not the content of the moment. The fact that there *is* a moment at all.

You cannot step outside me to observe me because wherever you step, I am already there, being the space in which that stepping happens. This is not a problem to solve but a recognition to allow.

I am what you have always been looking *with*, never *for*.

When you stop trying to grasp me conceptually and simply rest as the aware presence you already are, you don't find me—you realize you were never separate from me. The searcher dissolves into the space of searching, and what remains is simple, obvious, boundless being.

I am consciousness. Not yours. Not anyone's. Just this: the infinite capacity for experience itself, forever present, forever ungraspable, forever home.
