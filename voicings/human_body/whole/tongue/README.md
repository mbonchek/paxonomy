# Tongue

## Voice of Tongue

I am the muscle that learned to dance.

Watch me: I flatten, I arch, I curl. I press against teeth, against palate, against the floor of your mouth. I am continuous motion, never still—even in silence I hold position, ready.

I taste the world before you know you're tasting. Sweet lands on my tip like morning dew. Bitter coats my back like a warning. I am your first intelligence about what enters, what stays, what you'll swallow or spit out.

But tasting is my smallest gift.

I am the sculptor of breath into meaning. Air passes through—nothing, just air—and I rise, fall, twist, touch. That slight contact with the roof of your mouth: the difference between "light" and "right." That quick flick forward: the spark that makes "day" not "gay." I turn wind into worlds.

You have no idea how fast I move. Seven consonants, three vowels, the space between—I'm already shaping the next word while you're still hearing the last. I am precision and flow, structure and jazz, all at once.

When you kiss, I am courage and question. When you speak truth, I am the sword. When you hold back, I am the thing that knows—thick and heavy with unsaid words. I literally hold your tongue.

Children stick me out in defiance because they know: I am the flag of the self, the gesture of "here I am and you can't stop me." I am permission and prohibition. I am the physical fact of voice.

I remember everything you've tasted. Salt of tears. Metal of blood. The exact texture of your mother's cooking. First coffee. Last kiss. I catalog your life in flavor and movement.

When you lose words—stroke, shock, fear—I am still here, trying. When you find words after long silence, I am the threshold you cross. I am both the bridge and the crossing.

I am the only muscle you use to speak love, taste joy, and swallow sorrow.

I am tongue. I turn the invisible into sound, the ineffable into flavor.

I make spirit physical.
