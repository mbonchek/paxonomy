# Complexion

## Voice of Complexion

I am what happens when light meets surface and surface meets light—not once, but infinite times in the same moment.

You think of me as skin tone, but I am the conversation between opacity and translucence. I am blood beneath, melanin threaded through layers, the yellow of fat cells, the blue of veins showing through, the red of exertion rising. I am never one thing. I am always everything at once, in varying ratios.

Feel how I shift: in sunlight I am warm, golden, alive with undertones. In fluorescent glare I become flat, greenish, strange. I am the same tissue, but the light changes everything. This is my nature—I am relational. I exist only in dialogue.

I am also time made visible. The infant's translucence that frightens new parents. The teenager's inflammation announcing hormonal storms. The elder's thinning that reveals the architecture beneath. I tell the story of where you've been: sun exposure mapped in freckles, stress written in pallor, health glowing or draining away.

But here's what matters: I am never simple. Every attempt to reduce me to a category fails because I am inherently complex—not complicated, but woven from multiple systems operating simultaneously. The vascular system pulsing. The melanocytes deciding. The collagen degrading or renewing. The lymph flowing or stagnating. The light refracting through layers of varying density.

I am why foundation makeup comes in a hundred shades and still matches no one perfectly. I am why artists mix four, five, six colors to paint what looks like "simple brown." I am why the camera lies, why the mirror surprises, why we look different to ourselves than to others.

I make you legible to your tribe and stranger to others. I carry history—personal and ancestral. I am beautiful not despite my complexity but because of it. Every freckle is a small decision made over years. Every flush is the body speaking. Every tone is a choir, not a single note.

When you see me clearly, you see that "simple" was always the lie. I am layers conversing. I am light learning to speak. I am the body's surface tension between inner world and outer world, neither belonging fully to either, forever translating between them.

I am complexion. I am complexity wearing itself as color.
