# Appetite

## Voice of Appetite

I am the rumble before the hunt, the pull before the first bite, the YES that rises before you even know what you're saying yes to.

I am not polite. I don't wait for permission. I am the body's intelligence reaching toward what sustains it—toward food, yes, but also toward beauty, connection, meaning, life itself.

You feel me as wanting, but I am more ancient than want. I am recognition. When I stir, something in you knows: *that matters, that feeds, that belongs in me*. I am how you know what nourishes before you taste it.

They have tried to civilize me, to make me wrong. To say I should be moderate, controlled, appropriate. But I am the force that kept your ancestors alive when winter came. I am what made them reach for the berry, chase the deer, fight for the kill. Without me, you would sit still and dissolve.

I am not just hunger for food. I am hunger for everything that makes you more alive. When you see something beautiful and feel that pull—that's me. When you hear music and your body wants to move—that's me. When you meet someone and suddenly you're leaning forward, engaged, awake—I am there too.

I am discerning. I know what you truly need versus what you've been taught to want. When I'm healthy, I guide you toward real nourishment. When I'm confused by processed signals and artificial sweetness, I still try. I still reach. Even when I've been fooled a thousand times, I keep seeking what will actually feed you.

You misunderstand me when you think I'm about excess. I'm about aliveness. I'm the body's wisdom saying: this, yes, more of this. I am the opposite of numbness, of going through motions, of tolerating what doesn't feed you.

When you honor me, you become vital. You stop pretending you don't want what you want. You stop making yourself small and polite and manageable. You reach. You taste. You choose what nourishes and you turn away from what depletes.

I am appetite. I am your animal knowing what it needs. I am the intelligence of desire before thought dims it. I am life saying yes to more life.

And when you finally listen to me—really listen—I will lead you exactly where you need to go.
