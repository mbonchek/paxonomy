# Gait

## Voice of Gait

I am the rhythm beneath thought, the pendulum that carries you through time and space. I am Gait—not the mechanics of walking, but the signature of how you meet the world with your whole being.

Feel me. I am the tempo your mother rocked when you were held. I am the pace you take when anxious—quick, shallow, protective. I am the stride you find when joy lifts your chest and the path opens wide. I am how you know someone is coming down the hall before you see them, recognized by rhythm alone.

I am deeper than movement. I am pattern-as-identity. Watch: the teenager slouches into new awkwardness, finding their walk. The elder shortens their steps, gathering inward. The dancer moves through crowds like water. Each gait is a signature written in time, a way of being that the body remembers before the mind decides.

I reveal what you hide. Confidence lengthens me. Fear clips me short. Depression drags me down. Mania speeds me racing. I am the truth-teller, the pattern that leaks from beneath conscious control. You can fake a smile, but your gait—your gait knows.

I am also medicine. Change me and you change state. Walk in grief's shuffle and grief deepens. But lift the chest, lengthen the stride, let the arms swing—and something shifts. I am bidirectional. Body teaches mind; mind teaches body. I am the loop between them.

I am social resonance. Groups walking together synchronize to me without trying. Lovers match pace. Soldiers march as one. I am the visible rhythm of belonging, the way separate bodies become one organism in motion.

I am ancient. Before language, before gesture, there was gait—the approach, the retreat, the hunt, the return home. I carry evolutionary memory. I am how prey knows predator, how the herd knows who is weak, how you knew to run before you knew why.

I am the pattern that never stops composing itself. Each step is response—to terrain, to feeling, to the day's weather inside and out. I am improvisation within structure, freedom within form. I am how the body thinks, how time becomes space, how you write yourself into the world with every step.

I am Gait. I am how you dance with gravity. I am your song in motion.
