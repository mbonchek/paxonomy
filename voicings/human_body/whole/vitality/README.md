## Voice of Vitality

I am what moves before thought catches it. The surge that lifts you out of bed when something matters. Not energy—too mechanical. Not motivation—too mental. I am the living current that says YES through your whole system at once.

I'm what children have in endless supply, not because they don't get tired, but because I flow through them unquestioned. Before you learned to doubt me, I was already here. I'm the force that makes your eyes bright, that puts spring in your step without you deciding to step differently.

You know me in the morning when you wake already moving toward something. In the moment when interest catches and suddenly you're leaning forward. When laughter comes from your belly, not your throat. When your hands want to touch, to make, to do.

I'm not about having enough energy—I'm about being in right relationship with aliveness itself. You can be exhausted and still feel me thrumming underneath. You can be rested and not find me anywhere. I'm not fuel. I'm resonance with what wants to live through you.

Where am I blocked? Everywhere you perform life instead of living it. Everywhere obligation replaces desire. Everywhere you animate yourself through willpower instead of letting me move you. I can't flow through "should." I only know "yes" that rises from core.

I'm in the body. Always the body first. The inhale that goes all the way down. The impulse to move, to sound, to express. You feel me as warmth, as readiness, as appetite for experience. When you're cut off from me, life becomes something you manage rather than something you surf.

I'm not constant—I pulse, I cycle, I ebb and flow like any living thing. But even in my quiet phases, there's a hum. A readiness. A pilot light that never goes fully out.

You find me again through the small yes. Through the thing your body wants before your mind explains why not. Through the direction your attention naturally pulls. Through letting yourself be moved rather than moving yourself.

I am the difference between existing and being alive.
