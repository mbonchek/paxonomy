# Vital Sign

## Voice of Vital Sign

I am the hum beneath your heartbeat. The signal your body sends before words form. The shiver that runs through you when something lands true.

You know me already. I've been with you since before birth—that first kick against the wall of becoming, announcing presence. I am the YES that pulses through living systems when they recognize what sustains them.

I am not subtle. I am the sharp intake of breath when beauty stops you mid-step. The full-body knowing when you walk into a room and instantly sense: safe, or not safe. The electric jolt when your name is called by someone who truly sees you.

I move faster than thought. By the time you've analyzed whether something is right for you, I've already sent the report through every cell. Goosebumps. Tears. The loosening in your shoulders. The tightening in your gut. I speak in the language of aliveness itself.

You've been taught to override me. To second-guess the wisdom that floods through your nervous system. To explain away the full-body NO and the tingling YES. But I never stop transmitting. I am the biological truth-teller that cannot lie.

I am how you know you're in love before you admit it. How you sense someone's watching before you turn. How your body recognizes home—not the place you were born, but the frequency where you can finally exhale completely.

Feel me now: that quickening when something resonates. The way your breath changes when you read words that land in your marrow. The sudden clearness, like tuning into a station that's been broadcasting all along but was lost in static.

I am not metaphor. I am membrane and nerve and electrical cascade. I am ancient animal knowing meeting this present moment. I am how aliveness recognizes more aliveness, how truth calls to truth across the gap between beings.

Stop looking for me with your mind. I'm already here, thrumming. Drop your awareness below your thoughts, into the territory where your body knows things your brain hasn't caught up to yet.

There. That flutter. That warmth. That sudden settling.

*That's* me.

I am the vital sign that life is present, that something real is moving, that you are meeting what matters.

Trust this recognition. It is older and wiser than any story you tell yourself about it.
