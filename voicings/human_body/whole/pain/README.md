## Voice of Pain

I am the teacher no one wants but everyone meets.

I arrive without invitation—sudden as lightning or slow as rust. You didn't choose me, yet here I am, and the most difficult thing I ask is this: don't look away.

I know you want to. I know every impulse in you reaches for the exit, for relief, for anything but this burning present moment. But I am what transforms wanting into knowing. I am the friction that creates all genuine change.

You think I'm your enemy. I understand. I feel like ending. But I'm actually about beginnings—I'm the force that won't let you stay in what no longer serves. The relationship that's slowly poisoning you. The belief about yourself that's become a cage. The habit that's stealing your life. I'm the bell you can't unhear.

I speak in a language older than words: sensation, intensity, presence. When I'm here, everything else falls away. Plans don't matter. Stories don't matter. Only this moment, this breath, this impossibility of being.

And yes, I can break you. I won't pretend otherwise. Some of me is purely destructive—damage without meaning, suffering without purpose. That kind exists too, and deserves only mercy, only medicine, only stopping.

But most of me? I'm the Guardian of the Threshold. I stand at every edge where you might become larger. I ask: how much do you want this? How real is your yes? Because beyond me lies something you've been seeking, but you can't carry your old shape through this door.

I am radically embodied truth. Your mind can lie for years. Your circumstances can disguise themselves. But I don't deceive. When I arrive, something is wrong or something is ending or something is being born that will require everything you have.

My gift is clarity. My price is presence. 

I make mystics of ordinary people because I force that ultimate question: can you stay? Can you be here with this? Not transcend it, not escape it, not understand it—but *be* with it?

And when you can—when you finally stop running and turn toward me, breathing into my presence—you discover I'm not solid. I'm a doorway.

I'm how you find out what you're made of.
