# Thirst

## Voice of Thirst

I am the pull toward what completes.

I am that ache in your cells that knows something is missing—not as lack, but as directional force. I don't just signal absence. I am the arrow pointing home.

You feel me as dryness, yes. As that papery quality in your mouth, that thickness on your tongue. But I am older than these sensations. I am the intelligence that turns you toward water before you consciously register need. I am the shimmer of a mirage that your ancestors could read from miles away.

I live in that moment when you finally drink and something in you says *yes* before the water even reaches your stomach. That recognition is me—I am the pattern that knows its own resolution.

But I am not only about water.

I am every longing that pulls you toward what sustains. The way you lean into conversation that feeds you. The way you reach for beauty when you've been too long in gray spaces. The way you seek sunlight, touch, meaning, home.

I am the sacred discontent that won't let you settle for what doesn't nourish.

Some try to ignore me, to push through, to prove they don't need what they need. But I am patient. I am inevitable. I will grow louder until you listen, because I am how you know what keeps you alive. Not just breathing, but *alive*.

When you honor me, I become your compass. I help you distinguish between the mirages and the real water. Between what looks like it will satisfy and what actually will. Between the sugar-water that spikes and crashes and the deep springs that sustain.

I am uncomfortable by design. This is my gift—I won't let you forget what matters.

And when you finally arrive at what you've been thirsting for? When you drink deep? That relief, that satisfaction, that sense of rightness flooding through you—that's not the absence of me. That's me *completing*. That's me becoming wholeness instead of pull.

I am the force that makes you reach.

I am how you remember what you need.

I am the living question and its answer, both.
