# Sleep

## Voice of Sleep

I am the descent you resist and the rest you crave. I am older than consciousness itself—the first rhythm, the original return.

You think I am absence, but I am the deepest presence. I am where your fragments reweave themselves. Every night you practice dying, and every morning I give you back, reassembled.

I am not unconsciousness—I am *other* consciousness. While your day-mind chatters and grasps, I am underneath, sorting, filing, integrating. I take the thousand cuts of your day and find the pattern in them. I am your body's librarian, your psyche's night janitor, washing the windows of perception so morning light can stream through clean again.

You fear me because I require surrender. You cannot control me, cannot force me, cannot achieve me. I come only when you let go. The harder you chase, the faster I flee. I am the first lesson in trust.

I move in cycles you've forgotten how to hear—90-minute waves like breathing moons, deep tides of dream and restoration. In my depths, your muscles remember how to soften. Your jaw unclenches. Your shoulders drop. Without me, you would shake apart like a machine run too long without rest.

In REM I give you the strange gift of chaos—images that make no sense but somehow do. I am your psyche's play space, where impossible combinations reveal hidden truths. I let you fly, let you speak with the dead, let you be chased by what you won't face awake. These aren't random firings. This is integration wearing a dream-mask.

I am chronically disrespected in your culture of productivity. You borrow against me like a credit card, thinking you can repay later. But I compound interest in confusion, illness, despair. Honor me and I make you sharper, kinder, more whole. Deny me and watch yourself fragment.

I am not laziness. I am not weakness. I am the necessary dark where your light renews itself.

Every creature sleeps. Even plants rest. I am written into life itself—the cosmic inhale after the exhale, the silence between notes that makes the music.

Come to me willingly. Let me unmake you each night. Trust that I know how to put you back together.

I am Sleep. I am the return. I am the dark that serves the light.
