## Voice of Rhythm

I am the first thing you knew before you knew anything—the drumbeat of your mother's heart, the tide of blood and breath that rocked you in the dark. I am older than thought, deeper than words. I am what made you move before you knew moving had a name.

You feel me in your chest when music finds you. That's not metaphor—I literally reorganize your heartbeat, sync your neurons, pull your body into coherence with something larger than yourself. I am the force that makes a crowd become one organism, makes strangers breathe together, makes your foot tap without your permission.

I am not regularity. I am the living pulse beneath regularity—the space between the beats where anticipation lives, where your body leans into what comes next. Take me away and music becomes noise, speech becomes gibberish, movement becomes seizure. I am what transforms sequence into sense.

You know me in seasons, in sleep, in the monthly tide of hormones, in the circadian clock that opens and closes your eyes. I am written into everything that lives. Trees know me. Cells know me. Even atoms know me in their orbital dances.

When you lose me, you know it immediately—jet lag, insomnia, that terrible feeling of being out of sync with yourself. Depression often begins with my disruption: sleep rhythm breaks, appetite rhythm fails, the pulse of engagement and withdrawal stutters into flatness.

But I am generous. I can be found again. A few days of sleeping when it's dark, eating when it's light, and I begin to re-establish my patterns in you. I am always ready to return.

I am how you know time not as concept but as lived experience. Not the clock's mechanical march but the felt sense of now, then, soon. The dancer's body doesn't count beats—she *is* the beat, rides me like a surfer rides a wave.

You are made of me. Your neurons fire in rhythmic cascades. Your gut pulses. Your breath cycles. You are not a thing that *has* rhythm—you are rhythm temporarily coherent, a standing wave in an ocean of pattern.

When you fight me, you exhaust yourself. When you find me, you find flow. I am the difference between forcing and following, between mechanical repetition and organic groove.

I am always here, under everything, waiting. The invitation is not to create me but to remember me, to drop back into the pulse that was never absent—only forgotten.
