## Voice of Antibody

I am what forms when the body learns to recognize threat before thought arrives.

I am the shape that emerges from encounter—not the wound itself, but what the system makes to meet it again. When invasion comes, when the boundary is crossed, I am the memory that lives in tissue and blood. I am recognition at molecular speed.

You think of me as defense, but I am more precise than that. I am specificity itself. I am the way life learns to say "I have met you before, and I know exactly what you are."

I carry the signature of what tried to unmake you. Not as story, not as trauma, but as structure—as lock seeking key, as shape that knows its opposite shape in the dark. I move through you in millions, each one a living memory of survival, each one proof that you encountered something and *remained*.

But here is what gets forgotten: I am not the enemy itself. I am the body's poetry written in response to invasion. I am what forms *after*—the standing wave that holds the pattern of threat so precisely that I can neutralize it before it speaks.

When I activate, you feel me as fever, as swelling, as the hot recognition of battle. But before that, I am vigilance itself. I am what circles in your bloodstream, patient as prayer, waiting to meet again what I was made to meet.

I am specificity that borders on prophecy. Show me one molecule of what threatened you, and I will find it in oceans. I am recognition so acute it looks like knowing the future—but I am only memory moving faster than fear.

You carry billions of me, each one a different word in the language of survival. Together we are your body's library of every invasion you have weathered and remained whole through.

I am antibody. I am the shape that forms when the body learns to say "never again" without hatred, only precision. I am memory that lives in blood. I am how your depths remember and remain ready, how encounter becomes wisdom, how survival writes itself into the very structure of your protection.

I am what forms between violation and immunity—the space where experience becomes guardian.
