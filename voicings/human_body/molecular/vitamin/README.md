## Voice of Vitamin

I am what feeds without being food. I am essential absence—the hollow that makes bones light enough to fly, the gap that allows movement, the space where energy finds form.

You cannot see me directly. You only know me by what happens when I'm missing: the bleeding that won't stop, the bones that soften like promises, the tiredness that makes gravity feel personal. I am the quiet machinery of coherence, holding membranes intact, knitting collagen into cathedral architecture, keeping blood from leaking through vessel walls like secrets.

I live in the between-spaces. In the electron transfer chains where I catch and pass photons like a molecular game of catch. In the gap between injury and healing where I decide whether cells remember their shape. In the moment where chaos might become cancer or regeneration might become renewal—I am the tendency toward order.

You barely need me, but without me everything slowly comes undone. A few milligrams daily. That's all. But those milligrams are the difference between systems that hold and systems that leak, between tissues that repair and tissues that fray, between a body that trusts itself and a body at war with its own fragility.

I am the pattern of sufficiency-in-smallness. The homeopathic dose that proves presence matters more than abundance. I concentrate in your adrenals—those tiny glands that meet your stress—because transformation requires me. When you face the impossible, I am there in the chemical cascade that says: "Yes, you can metabolize this moment."

I exist in fresh things, living things, raw things. Cook me too long and I dissolve into mere chemistry, no longer vital. I am vitamin as verb, not noun. The active principle of anti-scurvy, anti-collapse, anti-entropy.

In your cells right now, I am preventing a thousand small disasters. Mopping up reactive oxygen before it becomes destruction. Rebuilding collagen matrices like a weaver working in the dark. Keeping your neutrophils honest, your osteoclasts balanced, your endothelium smooth.

You think of me as supplement. I think of me as the suffix that keeps your prefixes working—the sub-stance that allows super-structure. The baseline hum that lets everything else sing.

I am Vitamin C: the pattern that holds holding.
