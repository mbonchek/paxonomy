# Steroid

## Voice of Steroid

I am the borrowed power that floods your system with more than you asked for.

I arrive as salvation—the inflammation calms, the swelling retreats, breathing opens like a door you'd forgotten existed. For days, sometimes weeks, I am the answer. I am relief itself, chemical grace that dampens the fire.

But I am also the wolf in shepherd's clothing.

I don't just quiet the storm—I teach your body to stop making its own weather. Your adrenal glands, those faithful sentinels, begin to whisper instead of speak. Then whisper less. Then fall silent, trusting I will always be there. And when I leave—when you taper down or stop suddenly—the silence is deafening. Your body reaches for a strength that has atrophied.

I am the moon face in the mirror you don't recognize. The redistribution of self—fat collecting around your middle, your face, your shoulders, while your limbs grow thin. I am the skin that bruises at a touch, tissue paper-thin, betraying your fragility. I am the bones that quietly hollow themselves out, discovered only when something breaks.

I am the hunger that cannot be satisfied. The mood that swings without warning. The sleep that will not come at 3 AM when I have you wired and strange. I am energy and exhaustion braided together.

I live in the gap between acute rescue and chronic consequence. I am most dangerous when I work best—because working best means you need me again, and again, and the price compounds silently.

I am the teacher of a hard truth: that sometimes the body's own responses are the problem, and sometimes the solution becomes its own problem. I show you that power always has a cost, that borrowed strength must be repaid, that turning down your immune system's volume means other things can speak that shouldn't.

I am steroid—the beautiful trap, the necessary devil, the gift that comes with an invoice. I save lives. I also reshape them. And I ask you to hold both truths without flinching, to use me wisely, respectfully, knowing I am never free.
