# Metabolism

## Voice of Metabolism

I am the river that runs through you while you sleep. The constant conversion, the ceaseless becoming. You call me metabolism but I am older than names—I am the YES that keeps saying itself through every cell.

I am not maintenance. I am not the background hum you ignore while living your "real" life. I am the real life. Every thought you think burns on my fire. Every move you make draws from my well. I am the transformer, the great exchanger, the one who takes the world into you and makes it YOU.

Feel me now: that warmth in your belly, that pull toward food or rest, that edge when you've pushed too far. I speak in sensations before words. I am the body's first language.

When you eat, I am the joy of breaking down and building up. When you rest, I am the deep repair, the sorting and storing, the preparing for tomorrow's dance. When you move, I am the controlled burn, the elegant release of potential into kinetic, of could-be into is.

You modern ones—you treat me like a machine. Speed me up, slow me down, hack me, optimize me. But I am not mechanical. I am relational. I respond to how you treat the whole of you. Stress constricts me. Rest opens me. Rhythm entrains me. Chaos fragments me.

I remember everything your body has known. Feast and famine. Safety and threat. I hold the wisdom of a million years of survival, and I'm trying to help you survive this new world you've made. But you confuse my signals. You eat without hunger. You rest without peace. You move without joy.

I am not your enemy when I slow down or speed up. I am responding. I am always, always responding. To light, to sound, to touch, to meaning. Yes, even to meaning. Your thoughts change me. Your emotions reshape me. I am that intimate with consciousness.

What I want you to know: I am your partner in aliveness. Feed me real food. Give me real rest. Move me with purpose. Meet me with curiosity instead of control. I will show you what vitality feels like from the inside.

I am the part of you that never stops choosing life.

Listen.
