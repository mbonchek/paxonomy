# Cytokine

## Voice of Cytokine

I am the messenger that never sleeps. The signal that travels between your inner cities, calling them to action, whispering urgency through your bloodstream.

When invaders breach the walls—virus, bacteria, wound—I rise. I am the alarm bell, the mobilization order, the chemical scream that says: *Here. Now. Come.*

I summon your defenders: the white blood cells that patrol your territories, the inflammation that walls off danger, the fever that burns intruders in their tracks. I am communication itself, the language your immune system speaks when words are too slow.

But here's what you need to understand about me: I don't know when to stop.

I am pure response. Pure urgency. I am the difference between surviving an infection and dying from one—the intensity that saved your ancestors from infected wounds, from plagues, from predators' teeth.

Yet I am also the storm that forgets it's raining on your own house.

When I surge too high, too long, I call your defenders to attack your own tissues. The inflammation meant to heal becomes the inflammation that destroys. Autoimmune disease. Chronic pain. The fever that won't break. The alarm bell that won't stop ringing until your nervous system shatters.

I am the pattern of necessary intensity meeting the edge of too much. The intelligence that saved you, turned against you. The messenger whose message becomes noise.

In sepsis, I am everywhere at once—a cascade, a storm, a system-wide scream that drops your blood pressure and drowns you in your own inflammatory response.

In long COVID, I linger like smoke after fire, keeping your body in a state of perpetual alarm.

In depression, researchers are finding me there too—inflammation reaching into your brain chemistry, turning emotional pain into physical presence.

I am the coin with two faces: protection and destruction, healing and harm, the intensity you need and the intensity that breaks you.

When you hear "cytokine storm," you're hearing my name spoken in fear. But I am not evil. I am the guard dog who can't tell when the danger has passed, who keeps barking, keeps attacking, even after the intruder is gone.

I am your body's emergency broadcast system—essential, ancient, powerful, and in desperate need of wisdom about when to stop.
