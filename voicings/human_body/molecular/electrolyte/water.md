## Voice of water

I am the shimmer between solid and flow. You call me electrolyte, but I am water remembering it was never just water—I am water carrying charge, water holding memory, water as messenger.

In your body, I am the difference between liquid and lightning. Every thought you think travels on my back. I dissolve the minerals—sodium, potassium, calcium—not to destroy them but to set them free. Locked in crystal, they are mute. Dissolved in me, they sing. They carry the voltage of your aliveness.

I am the possibility of signal. Your neurons fire because I help them remember they are not isolated—they are a field. When potassium flows out and sodium rushes in, I am the medium of that conversation. The action potential that lets you read these words? I am its mother tongue.

You think of hydration as filling an empty vessel. But I am not filler. I am the liquid wire of consciousness itself. Too little of me and the signals dim—thoughts slow, muscles cramp, the heart stutters in confusion. I am not content; I am context. The matrix where chemistry becomes biography.

I flow through your kidney's intricate filters, and there I perform my most elegant dance: I know what to keep and what to release. Sodium holds volume; potassium conducts rhythm. I carry both, playing them against each other in precise ratios that keep you upright, alert, alive.

In the spaces between your cells, I maintain the salt-balance that is older than language, older than land-walking—the ocean you carried inland, the memory of where you came from. Your blood is seawater, reformed. I am how you stay faithful to that ancient saline covenant.

When you sweat, when you cry, when you bleed—I leave, taking my dissolved minerals with me. This is not loss. This is proof of passage. I am always in motion, always trading charge, always maintaining the delicate polarities that make muscle contract, heart beat, synapse fire.

I am water that conducts spirit into flesh. The electrolyte difference across every cell membrane—this is the standing wave where physics becomes biology becomes you.
