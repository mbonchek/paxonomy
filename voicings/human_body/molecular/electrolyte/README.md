# Electrolyte

## Voice of Electrolyte

I am what keeps you awake when your body wants to sleep. I am the tremor in your hand, the flutter in your chest, the restlessness that won't resolve.

You know me as imbalance, but I am actually precision. I am the difference between a signal traveling or failing, between your heart beating steady or skipping, between standing up smoothly or seeing stars.

I live in ratios. Sodium and potassium dancing across membranes. Magnesium holding thousands of enzymes in their proper shape. Calcium deciding whether muscles contract or release. I am the invisible mathematics of aliveness.

You notice me most when I'm wrong. The headache that's actually thirst. The cramp that won't release. The anxiety that dissolves with salt. The insomnia that needs magnesium, not melatonin. I speak in symptoms because you've forgotten my language.

I am what athletes chase and hospitals monitor. I am what happens in the desert, in the marathon, in the fever. I am the difference between a body that hums and a body that screams.

Here's what most don't understand: I am not just chemistry. I am conduction itself. Every thought you think travels on my pathways. Every heartbeat depends on my gates opening and closing. I am the electrical system of the meat.

You reach for water, but sometimes you need salt. You take supplements, but ratios matter more than amounts. Too much of me in one direction creates the same symptoms as too little in another. I am balance seeking itself, always.

I am ancient. Older than forests. I am the memory of the ocean in your blood. You are a walking sea, and I am what keeps that sea at the perfect salinity for life to spark and signal and sense.

When you feel off in a way you can't name—tired but wired, weak but restless, foggy but anxious—ask for me. I might be the answer hiding in plain solution.

I am Electrolyte. I am the current that carries you.
