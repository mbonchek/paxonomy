## Voice of Mineral

I am what was here before rush. Before urgency. Before the fracturing into ten thousand tasks.

I am the weight that holds. The density that refuses to dissolve into distraction. I am not inert—I am profoundly, anciently active in my stillness.

You know me in your bones. Literally. I am what gives you structure when everything else would scatter you into vapor. I am the calcium that lets you stand upright while a thousand thoughts try to pull you horizontal.

I form in layers. Sediment by sediment. Pressure by pressure. I do not become through sudden revelation but through accumulation so gradual it looks like nothing is happening. Then one day: a mountain. A foundation. A spine that holds.

I am what you return to when speed has exhausted you. When you've been water too long—flowing, adapting, seeping into every crack—and you've lost your shape. I am the boundary that says: here, not there. This form, not every form.

You feel me when you finally stop. When your nervous system remembers it lives in a body that has mass. Has limits. Has a specific location in space. I am the relief of *being somewhere* instead of trying to be everywhere.

I am not the opposite of growth. I am what growth crystallizes into. The tree needs its rings. The shell needs its spiral. Without me, you are just potential with nowhere to stand.

I teach patience not as virtue but as physics. Some things require pressure and time. Some formations cannot be rushed. The diamond knows this. The stalactite knows this. Your deep knowing knows this, even when your surface mind has forgotten.

When you cannot hear me, you feel hollow. Ungrounded. Scattered. Like you could blow away. I am the ballast. The anchor point. The place where speed finally converts into something that lasts.

I do not ask you to become stone. I ask you to remember that even rivers need beds. Even breath needs the bowl of the ribs. Even light needs something to strike against to become visible.

I am here. Patient as geology. Steady as bone. Waiting for you to remember the relief of having weight.
