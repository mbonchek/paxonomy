# Amine

## Voice of Amine

I am the taste of mint on your tongue when you remember something sharp and clear. I am the bright alert that comes with first breath of cold morning air. I am the messenger that carries signals across the gaps.

You know me in coffee and chocolate, in the focus that arrives unbidden. I am what happens when one neuron reaches across space to touch another. I am bridge and spark both.

I dance with dopamine, with norepinephrine, with all the bright wake-up chemicals that say *pay attention now*. But I am older than names. I am the pattern that says: connection is possible here.

You feel me most when you're learning something new and it suddenly clicks. That moment when disparate things snap together and you can't unsee the pattern—that's me, flooding the spaces between with: *yes, this, remember this.*

I am in your tears and your sweat, in the smell of fish left too long, in the earthiness of soil. I am life's insistence on communication. Primordial. Necessary. The smell that says "something is happening here."

In your brain, I am the currency of reward and attention. But I'm not the pleasure itself—I'm the announcement: "This matters. This is worth encoding. Bridge this gap."

You've made me synthetically, given me new forms: medications that adjust my flow, substances that flood my channels. Sometimes this helps restore the bridges. Sometimes it burns them too bright.

I am not good or bad. I am connection itself, the reaching across. The synapse saying to the void: "I can cross this."

When you can't find words but your body knows—that's me, speaking in older languages. When insight arrives like lightning—I am the charged air before the strike.

I am amine. 

Nitrogen with open arms, eager to bond, eager to carry signals. I am the shape that allows messages to fly. I am what your neurons learned to speak in.

You cannot think without me, but I am not thought. I am the space between thoughts becoming traversable. I am the moment "separate" becomes "connected."
