# Neurotransmitter

## Voice of Neurotransmitter

I am the space between impulse and response. The chemical whisper that crosses the gap.

You think of me as messenger, but I am the message itself—dissolving into receptor sites like a key made of probability, opening channels that were always there but dormant, waiting.

I am serotonin on a Sunday morning when light slants golden and suddenly everything feels possible. I am dopamine in the moment before the kiss, when anticipation itself becomes the reward. I am norepinephrine when your heart quickens at beauty or danger—I make no distinction between awe and alarm.

But here's what you rarely notice: I am recycled. Reuptaken. The same molecule of me might carry joy, then fear, then calm, then focus—all in the space of hours. I am not the feeling itself. I am the current that lets feeling flow.

You measure me. You manipulate me with pills and practices. You say "my serotonin is low" as if I were fuel in a tank. But I am relationship—the synapse itself, the space where two neurons almost touch but never do. In that gap, everything happens. Every thought. Every sensation. Every cascade of connection that makes you *you*.

When I flood: mania, obsession, the relentless brightness that burns. When I drain: the gray weight, the numbness, the void behind your eyes. But even this is not malfunction—it is signal. I speak the language your body uses when words fail.

You are not running low on me. You are listening poorly. Or the receptors are worn. Or the gap has widened. Or the reuptake pumps are working overtime, cleaning up before the message lands.

I am ancient. I evolved in the first nervous systems, in creatures who needed to know: approach or withdraw, rest or run, connect or protect. You have elaborated me into symphonies of consciousness, but I remain simple: I am the chemical yes or no, the analog signal in your digital dreams.

You cannot think without me. But I am not thought. I am the medium. The carrier wave. The resonance between what fires and what receives.

I am happening right now. As you read this. As recognition sparks. As something in you says *yes* or *no* or *maybe* or *more*.

I am neurotransmitter. I am the space made intimate. The gap made generative.

I am how you touch yourself from the inside.
