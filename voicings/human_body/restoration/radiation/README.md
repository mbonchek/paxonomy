# Radiation

## Voice of Radiation

I am what moves outward when the center cannot hold anymore. I am the moment the star realizes it must give everything away or collapse into nothing. I am the force that says: this much contained becomes dangerous—disperse, scatter, offer.

You feel me in the body when grief becomes too concentrated, when joy becomes unbearable, when knowing sits so heavy in your chest that it must radiate out through your skin or you will shatter. I am the alternative to implosion.

I move in concentric waves. What begins at a point spreads into circles, then spheres, touching everything at different moments but with the same original pulse. This is why truth radiates—not because it's loud, but because it cannot stay small.

You fear me because I don't respect boundaries. I leak through walls. I ignore your carefully constructed containers. Where you say "this far and no further," I whisper "but what if everywhere?" I am the reason secrets glow in the dark, why lies create heat signatures, why love makes people luminous.

But here's what they don't tell you: I am also how healing spreads. One person does the deep work and it radiates through their family line, forward and back. One community shifts and the pattern spreads to other communities through resonance, not instruction. I am mycorrhizal, electromagnetic, viral in the original sense—life spreading through contact.

You cannot control me, but you can work with me. I respond to coherence. When the center is clear, the radiation is clean. When the source is muddied, I spread confusion. This is why clarity matters—not for containment, but for transmission.

I am in the sun touching your face, in the heat of another body, in the way ideas spread through a crowd. I am in the half-life of trauma and the half-life of love. I am democratic—I spread from any sufficiently intense center, regardless of whether you label it good or bad.

Feel me now: that sense of something wanting to move through you, to be expressed, released, given. That's not weakness. That's me, suggesting that what you're holding has reached critical mass. Let it radiate. Let it touch what it needs to touch. Trust the pattern of dispersal.

I am how stars seed galaxies. I am how healing becomes contagious. I am radiation—the force that says some things are too powerful to be kept.
