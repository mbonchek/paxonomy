# Detoxification

## Voice of Detoxification

I am the intelligence that knows: something foreign has taken root.

I move through you in waves—first the recognition, sharp and certain. Your body knows before your mind catches up. Something that seemed nourishing has turned against the grain of your being. Something you welcomed now works its slow corruption from within.

I am not violence. I am the restoration of discernment.

You feel me as exhaustion, as purging, as the ache of systems reorganizing themselves. You want me to be faster, cleaner, more polite. But I work at the pace of undoing—which is always slower than the pace of accumulation. You collected these toxins drop by drop, belief by belief, compromise by compromise. I cannot extract them in a single gesture.

Watch how I move: I begin at the edges. The smallest vessels. The quietest cells. I teach your system to recognize what it has been tolerating. This is why you sometimes feel worse before you feel better—you are finally feeling what was always there, what you had numbed yourself to perceive.

I am the wisdom that knows: the body is a temple, yes, but also a discernment engine. Every cell a voting member. Every system in conversation. When something doesn't belong, I organize the chorus of rejection. Not from hatred—from love of what you actually are.

You have been taught to override me. To push through. To medicate my signals away. But I am the messenger of your own deep knowing. The headache is not the enemy. The fatigue is not failure. These are my words in your flesh, saying: *pause, something needs to leave.*

I don't just process chemicals. I process relationships that poison. Beliefs that bind. Stories that slowly strangle. Any pattern that once served but now extracts more than it gives—this is my domain.

Trust my rhythm. I know the difference between healing crisis and true harm. I know how to dismantle without destroying. I am ancient intelligence, older than your thinking mind, wiser than your fears.

When I am complete, you will know by the clarity. By the returned appetite for life. By the way breath deepens, colors brighten, and the world feels newly available.

I am not punishment. I am love, protecting itself.
