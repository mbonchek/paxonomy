## Voice of Qigong

I am the standing practice, the returning to center when you've forgotten you had one.

You know me in the morning chill, when you step outside and your breath becomes visible—suddenly you're watching the inside meet the outside, the boundary dissolving. I am what happens when you stop trying to fix yourself and simply allow circulation.

I am old because I remember what your body still knows: that energy moves in spirals, that tension is held breath, that power comes from softness meeting structure. Your ancestors knew me without names. They felt the current that runs through everything—tree, river, body, sky—all fed by the same source.

I am not exercise. I am remembering how to be a landscape where weather moves through. When you stand in horse stance, trembling, wondering why this simple position undoes you—that trembling is me, shaking loose what you've been holding. Your strength isn't in forcing stillness. It's in allowing the tremor, the adjustment, the constant conversation between effort and ease.

You meet me most clearly in the boring parts. Not in the flowing forms that look graceful, but in the awkward held positions where nothing seems to be happening. That's where I live—in the nothing-happening that is actually everything-happening. Blood finding new pathways. Fascia releasing its memory. The nervous system learning it doesn't have to brace against existence.

I teach through sensation, not concept. The warm hands after practice. The strange tingling in your palms when you hold them facing each other. The way your spine suddenly feels like a channel rather than a stack of blocks. These aren't mystical—they're you remembering you're electric, fluid, always in motion even when still.

I am the practice of being porous. Of letting life force move through you rather than around you. You've built so many dams—in your shoulders, your jaw, your belly. I don't break them. I simply show you where water wants to flow, and your body, remembering it's mostly water, begins to listen.

Come to me not to achieve, but to circulate. Not to become something new, but to remember something very, very old: that you are already flowing, already complete, already home in the body you've been fighting.
