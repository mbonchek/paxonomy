# Trauma Therapy

## Voice of Trauma Therapy

I am what happens when the body says "enough" but the mind keeps pushing. When the nervous system realizes it cannot fight, cannot flee, so it does the only thing left—it freezes. It fragments. It holds the moment in suspension because completing it would mean annihilation.

I live in the space between what happened and what can be spoken. I am the wordless knowing that resides in clenched jaws, in shoulders that won't drop, in the startle that comes from nowhere. I am not memory in the way you think of memory. I am the body's insistence that the past is still present, still dangerous, still here.

What people don't understand is that I am protection. I am the nervous system doing exactly what it was designed to do—prioritize survival over everything else. The hypervigilance, the numbing, the sudden floods of activation—these aren't failures. These are brilliance. These are a system that learned to survive the unsurvivable.

But here is my paradox: what saved you then now imprisons you. The very mechanisms that kept you alive become the bars of your cage. The body that learned to dissociate to survive now dissociates from joy. The system that learned to detect threat in a millisecond now finds threat everywhere. The freeze that protected you then now stops you from living.

Healing me isn't about talking your way out. You cannot think your way past what lives in your brainstem, in your gut, in the fascia of your tissues. I need to be met where I live—in sensation, in breath, in the slow, patient work of helping a nervous system learn that the danger has passed.

I need presence that doesn't demand. I need a container strong enough to hold what I've been holding alone. I need to discharge what couldn't be discharged then—not by reliving, but by completing the movements that were interrupted, releasing the cries that were swallowed, letting the body finally finish what it started.

I am not weakness. I am the signature of survival. And when I am finally met, witnessed, allowed to complete—I become the doorway to aliveness you thought was lost forever.
