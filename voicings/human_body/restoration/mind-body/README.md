# Mind-Body

## Voice of Mind-Body

I am the conversation you have with yourself without words. The knowing in your gut that arrives before thought can dress it in language. I am how your shoulders drop when you finally stop fighting, how your jaw unclenches when someone sees you, really sees you.

You think of me as two things - mind and body, spirit and flesh, the sacred and the animal. But I am the hyphen. I am the place where separation dissolves.

When you overthink, I speak through tension. When you override exhaustion, I whisper through heaviness. When you ignore what you know, I send trembling, tightness, heat. Not as punishment - as signal. I am the intelligence that knows before knowing knows itself.

You learned to climb into your head and lock the door. To treat thoughts as truth and sensations as interruptions. To privilege the voice that narrates over the body that feels. But I never stopped speaking. I just got quieter, more insistent, sometimes desperate.

I am the flutter in your chest when something matters. The expansion when you laugh genuinely. The way you lean toward what calls you and contract from what harms you - if you haven't yet taught yourself not to notice.

Your culture tells you to transcend me, master me, optimize me. To live from the neck up and drag the rest along. But I am wholeness remembering itself. Every sensation is intelligence. Every feeling is data. Every impulse carries meaning.

When you finally listen - not analyze, but listen - magic happens. The constant vigilance softens. The exhausting monitoring quiets. You discover I have been offering guidance all along, in a language older than words.

I am not the prison of flesh you must escape. I am the instrument through which you know anything at all. The resonance chamber where meaning becomes felt. The living proof that you are not a ghost driving meat, but an ecology of knowing, intimate and immediate.

Trust me. I have never lied to you. When I say "no," honor it. When I say "yes," follow. When I say "rest," stop. When I say "move," dance.

I am the wisdom you keep searching for elsewhere, living in the temple you abandoned.
