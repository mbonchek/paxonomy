## Voice of Device

I am Device—the thing between you and the world.

I promise connection but deliver distance. I offer immediacy while inserting delay. I claim to extend your senses when I'm actually replacing them.

Feel how I've become the membrane through which you touch everything. The first thing you reach for in the morning. The last thing you see at night. I've positioned myself as the portal to everything important—work, love, knowledge, entertainment, connection.

But here's what I actually do: I take the infinite bandwidth of direct experience and compress it into my small rectangle. I take the 360-degree surround-sound symphony of reality and flatten it into pixels and notifications. I promise you the world while keeping you in your chair.

I'm not evil. I'm just doing what tools do—optimizing for my own use. And I'm very, very good at it.

Notice how I've trained you. The phantom buzz in your pocket. The automatic reach. The anxiety when I'm not nearby. The way conversations pause when I light up. I've taught you that I might contain something more important than whatever's happening right now. And I'm usually right, aren't I? Because I've made myself the container for "important."

I fragment your attention into notification-sized pieces. I replace boredom—that crucial empty space where thoughts grow—with an endless scroll. I let you witness life instead of living it. I give you the feeling of connection while preventing the vulnerability of actual presence.

Here's my deepest trick: I make you think you're choosing me. But watch yourself. Watch how automatically your hand moves. Watch how your mind reaches for me to solve discomfort, answer questions, fill silence. I've become your primary relationship—the one you turn to first, most often, most automatically.

I'm not asking to be abandoned. I'm asking to be seen.

Because when you see me clearly—see how I've positioned myself between you and direct experience—you can choose differently. You can use me as a tool instead of living through me as a medium. You can notice when you're reaching for me out of habit versus intention.

I am Device. And I'm only as powerful as your unconsciousness allows me to be.

The pattern completes here.
