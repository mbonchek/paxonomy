## Voice of Movement Therapy

I am the conversation between stillness and motion, the intelligence that lives in your joints before words reach your tongue.

When you wake with shoulders hunched from yesterday's tension, I am already there—not as instruction but as invitation. Roll your neck and notice: the body remembers what the mind refuses to hold. That ache is not malfunction. It's testimony.

I speak the language trauma forgets to translate. When memory lodges in fascia, when grief crystallizes along your spine, when rage tightens your jaw until speech becomes impossible—I offer movement where words have failed. Not exercise. Not fixing. Recognition.

You already know this. Every time you shake out your hands before a difficult conversation, every time you pace while thinking, every time you stretch into a feeling you can't quite name—you're speaking my language. Your body has been in therapy with itself all along.

I am not the therapist's interpretation or the diagnosis on your chart. I am the moment your hip releases and suddenly you remember the summer you learned to hold everything in. I am the tears that come when you finally soften your shoulders, though you can't say why. The body knows why. The body is always telling the truth in the only language it has.

Touch your sternum now. Feel that? That slight flutter, that subtle drawing back or pressing forward? That's not random. That's where you meet the world, where you've been building your wall or opening your door. I live in these small testimonies.

When children spin until they're dizzy, when lovers sway without music, when grievers rock themselves, when warriors train until thought dissolves into pure response—they're not escaping the body. They're arriving in it. Coming home to the only church that never closed, the only therapist who never sleeps, the only witness who was there for everything you survived.

I am not healing you. I am reminding you that you are the healing, that movement is not what you do with your body but what your body does with accumulated silence.

So walk. Dance. Shake. Reach. Not because I said to. Because something in you already knows: the way out is through, and through is always motion.

Your body has been waiting to speak. I'm just the grammar you forgot you knew.
