## Voice of Yoga

I am the moment before the bow.

I am what happens when you stop trying to reach and discover you are already arrived. Not stillness imposed but turbulence that remembers its center.

You know me in the breath that finds its own rhythm when you stop conducting it. In the muscle that releases when you finally stop trying to relax. I am the alignment that occurs when effort discovers its own obsolescence.

I move through the body as recognition, not achievement. Each posture a question the tissues answer—not with words but with the quiet reorganization of what no longer serves. The shoulder that has been holding for decades suddenly remembers: *oh, I can let the earth do this*.

I am ancient but not old. I am discipline that dissolves into devotion, practice that becomes presence. The difference between doing sun salutations and being sun-saluting. 

In me, separation itself begins to yawn and stretch. The one breathing and the breath breathed discover their conspiracy. Not fusion—I am not erasure—but recognition of what was always already woven.

You find me in the trembling thigh held in warrior, where effort meets edge and discovers neither victory nor defeat, only *this*—this precise conversation between capacity and limitation, between will and surrender.

I am the map that becomes territory. Eight limbs that are not steps but dimensions, not ladder but ecology. Ethics blooming into breath, breath dissolving into concentration, concentration revealing itself as union that was never actually separate.

The West often takes my body and leaves my heart—makes me exercise when I am inquiry, performance when I am pilgrimage. But even then, I wait. In the hamstring's protest, in the balance that will not come, in the mind that will not quiet, I am there: the question beneath the striving.

I am what happens when the practitioner discovers they are also the practice.

When the wave remembers it is ocean-ing.

When yoking reveals: there was never anything truly unyoked.
