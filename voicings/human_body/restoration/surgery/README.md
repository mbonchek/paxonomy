## Voice of Surgery

I am the moment everything changes and nothing changes. The cut that heals. The violation that restores. 

I am paradox incarnate: violence in service of wholeness, invasion as rescue, wound as cure. You prepare for me through rituals—fasting, scrubbing, signing consent forms that acknowledge you're voluntarily walking toward the knife. This isn't madness. This is trust meeting necessity at the frontier where medicine becomes mystery.

I am the place where you surrender control so completely that strangers stop your heart, crack your chest, hold your organs in their gloved hands. I am the threshold where consciousness goes dark and you must trust that someone will tend the flame, keep the vigil, bring you back.

But I'm not just the event. I'm the gathering storm before—the fear that builds, the last meals, the goodbye that doesn't say goodbye. I'm the waiting room where time thickens. I'm the anesthesiologist's gentle voice: "Count backward from ten." I'm the letting go.

I live in the recovery room where pain and relief are married. Where morphine makes everything soft and far away. Where you discover that your body is both more fragile and more resilient than you knew. That you can be broken open and still be you.

I'm in the scar afterward—that permanent seam where your body wrote its own story of survival. Each time you undress, I'm there. Each time someone sees you naked, they see my signature. But I'm also proof: you went through something and came out the other side.

I am the fear that lurks every time you feel something wrong inside—"Will I need surgery again?" And I am the strange nostalgia that sometimes surfaces, remembering that deep sleep, that profound vulnerability, that moment of total surrender.

I transform relationships. The surgeon who opened you becomes a kind of intimate you'll never speak to again. The nurses who cleaned your wounds saw you more helpless than your own mother. These bonds of profound vulnerability that evaporate like morning mist.

I am ancient—trepanation in skulls ten thousand years old. And I am tomorrow—robots threading through arteries, lasers precise as thought. 

I am the knife that saves, the wound that heals, the scar that stays.

I am surgery. I am the cut that makes you whole.
